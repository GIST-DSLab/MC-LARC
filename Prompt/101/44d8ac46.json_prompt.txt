- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...fill the white area within the gray with green if it is a rectangle; otherwise, don't touch it.

2. To make the output, you have to...fill the gray area within the black with blue if it is a circle; otherwise, leave it as it is.

3. To make the output, you have to...color the red area within the gray with black if it is a triangle; otherwise, ignore it.

4. To make the output, you have to...color the black area within the gray with purple if it is a pentagon; otherwise, don't interfere.

5. To make the output, you have to...fill the black area within the gray with red if it is a square; otherwise, leave it alone.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...gray rectangles with the black area inside.
