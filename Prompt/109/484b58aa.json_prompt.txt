- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...remove the black spots entirely to ensure that they do not mar the uniform pattern of the grid.

2. To make the output, you have to...invert the diagonal pattern in the spaces with the black spots, creating a contrast to the rest of the grid.

3. To make the output, you have to...expand the size of the black spots instead of filling them in, keeping the overall grid pattern uneven.

4. To make the output, you have to...fill in the black spots with the continued diagonal pattern that is in the rest of the input so it looks like there is a uniform pattern on the whole grid

5. To make the output, you have to...replace the black spots with random patterns that do not necessarily follow the diagonal pattern of the rest of the grid.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a colored grid with a repeating pattern with some black spots that cover some parts of repeating pattern.
