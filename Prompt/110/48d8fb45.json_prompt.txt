- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...repeat the entire colored area, including the grey square.

2. To make the output, you have to...only repeat the grey square, disregarding the rest of the colored area.

3. To make the output, you have to...remove the colored area while maintaining the grey square.

4. To make the output, you have to...repeat the colored area that includes a grey square, but do not include the gray square.

5. To make the output, you have to...exclude both the colored area and the grey square.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a 10x10 grid with differently colored shapes. One of those shapes includes a grey pixel.
