- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...rotate the bottom half of the grid by 180 degrees onto the 3x4 grid.

2. To make the output, you have to...break apart the pattern in the bottom half of the grid and scatter its pieces throughout the 3x4 grid.

3. To make the output, you have to...draw diagonal lines across the bottom half of the grid into 3x4 and extend it to the top half.

4. To make the output, you have to...copy the pattern as you see it on the bottom half of the grid into 3x4. Once done, flip the pattern up to the top half of the 3x4 grid.

5. To make the output, you have to...use the bottom half of the grid as motif for the top half in 3x4 grid.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...grid of 3x4 with 2 colors.
