- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... keep everything the same, but add blue squares around the red squares in order to create a row vertically and a row side to side that are overlapping and of the same range.

2. To make the output, you have to... remove the blue squares entirely and replace them at the corners, creating a large square of red squares in the middle. 

3. To make the output, you have to... remove all the shapes and then re-draw the blue squares, creating a cluster in the center with no overlap. 

4. To make the output, you have to... change all red squares to green circles and place them randomly, then surround each one with a blue square.

5. To make the output, you have to... transform the blue squares into triangles and scatter them around the edges, leaving the red squares as is.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a lot of black and gray pixels with red patterns in different places throughout the grid.
