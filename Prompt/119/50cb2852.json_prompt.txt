- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...color the inside of each colored area with dark blue. Leave the outside of the colored shapes the example color one cube deep all the way around.

2. To make the output, you have to...color the outside of each colored area with light blue. Leave the inside of the colored shapes the example color one cube deep all the way around.

3. To make the output, you have to... fill the exterior of each colored shape with light blue. Leave the interior of the colored shapes the example color one cube deep all the way around.

4. To make the output, you have to...color the inside of each colored area with light blue. Leave the outside of the colored shapes the example color one cube deep all the way around.

5. To make the output, you have to...color the inside of each colored area with light blue. Leave the outside of the colored shapes an entirely different color one cube deep all the way around.
