The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

4. To make the output, you have to...add a yellow block on the bottom row of the grid under the black block in the colored shape/shapes.

5. To make the output, you have to...replace the black block with a blue one in the colored shape/shapes.
