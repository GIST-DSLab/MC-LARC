- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

3. To make the output, you have to... replace green by light blue, dark blue by purple, yellow by red, red by orange colors and replace black boxes with the same color in the center.

4. To make the output, you have to... change green with purple, dark blue with yellow, yellow with orange, and red with light blue colors and replace white boxes with the same color in the center.

5. To make the output, you have to... swap green with yellow, dark blue with orange, yellow with light blue, and red with purple colors and replace black boxes with the border color.
