- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... randomly pick a color from the input grid and make the entire grid that color.

2. To make the output, you have to... use all the colors in the input grid to make a rainbow.

3. To make the output, you have to... use different colors to create a pattern in the input grid.

4. To make the output, you have to... select the least used color from the input grid and paint the entire grid in that color.

5. To make the output, you have to... determine which color is used the most in the input grid and make the entire grid that color.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see... 3x3 grid with many different color pixels.
