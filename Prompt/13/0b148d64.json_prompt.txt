- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...alter the output grid to fit the space of the uncolored area that is the same color with the others.

2. To make the output, you have to...adjust the input grid to align with the shaded area that is the same color as the rest.

3. To make the output, you have to...modify the output grid to conform to the area of the different color from the rest.

4. To make the output, you have to...make the output grid match the space of the colored area that is the odd color from the rest.

5. To make the output, you have to...change the output grid to correspond with the space of the neutral area that matches the rest.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a rectangular pattern in each corner, one a different color than the others.
