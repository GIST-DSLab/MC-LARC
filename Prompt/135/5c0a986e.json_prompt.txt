- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...follow the diagonal from the top left corner of the red box to the bottom right corner of the blue box and fill it with yellow boxes.

2. To make the output, you have to...fill the entire grid with blue boxes starting from the top left corner and stopping at the bottom right corner of the red box.

3. To make the output, you have to...draw a line of gray boxes from the center of the grid to the bottom right corner of the grid without touching any colored 2x2 boxes.

4. To make the output, you have to...create a single line of boxes matching the color of the 2x2 box. Begin with the top left corner of the blue and the bottom right of the red and go out to the edge of the grid.

5. To make the output, you have to...begin at the top right corner of the red box and the bottom left of the blue box and fill every other pixel in the grid with green boxes.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...two boxes, one red and one blue, that are 2x2.
