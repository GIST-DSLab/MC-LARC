- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... start from the middle and continuously circle outward until you reach the edge. The radius of the circle should increase at the same pace throughout the process.

2. To make the output, you have to... use the two outer dots to form a square around the dot in the middle, then continue making squares surrounding the last square you created until you can not make any more (do not stop when you can not get an entire square inside the black background, even if you have enough room to make one line and the rest of the square would be outside of the black background then make that line). The amount of black space between each box should be the same width as the first square you created (so if the first box width of 2, make them all a width of 2)

3. To make the output, you have to... randomly place dots throughout the black background. Each dot should decrease in size as it gets farther from the center.

4. To make the output, you have to... create a series of triangles starting from the outer edges and working toward the center. The space between each triangle should be the same width as the first triangle you created.

5. To make the output, you have to... generate a series of ovals starting from the center and moving outward. The space between each oval should remain consistent based on the width of the initial oval.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see... three dots of one color in large black grid. They are alinged diagonally.
