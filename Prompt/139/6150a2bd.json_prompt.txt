- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... rotate the whole grid two times. Imagine that the entire grid has been flipped both horizontally and vertically. Once you picture it, you can create the output grid.

2. To make the output, you have to... expand the grid using the scale factor of 2. The scaled grid can be used for output.

3. To make the output, you have to... turn the grid 45 degrees, and then mirror the grid. This rotation will create the desired output.

4. To make the output, you have to... colour the corners of the grid in blue. Remember to pick the right shade of blue for the corners.

5. To make the output, you have to... resize the grid keeping the proportion same. The rescaling will provide the required output.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see.. a 3x3 grid with a multicolored shape in it.
