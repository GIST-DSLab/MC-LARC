- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... rotate the whole grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise and sustain the green color.

2. To make the output, you have to...change so that the top left corner color changes to light blue instead of green. same with lower green 2by 2 grid

3. To make the output, you have to... slide the middle row to the left while changing the top left corner color to yellow.

4. To make the output, you have to... adjust the 3 by 3 grid to the bottom right, while maintaining the original colour.

5. To make the output, you have to... flip the whole layout horizontally and make the top left corner color red.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see.. green pixels that are continuously connected in the up, down, left, and right directions, as well as green pixels that are separated or connected diagonally.
