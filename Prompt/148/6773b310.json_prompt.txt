- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...throw 2 pink squares, mark that area with a red circle on the old grid. Double squares are shown as white.

2. To make the output, you have to...hide 2 pink triangles, identify that space with a green line on the current grid. Half squares are shown as grey.

3. To make the output, you have to...manipulate 2 pink circles, demonstrate that region with an orange triangle on the previous grid. Multiple squares are shown as pink.

4. To make the output, you have to...destroy 2 pink hexagons, indicate that section with a yellow star on the next grid. Quarter squares are shown as brown.

5. To make the output, you have to...hold 2 pink squares, represent that area with a blue box on the new grid. Single squares are shown as black.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...9 square sections divided by light blue vertical and horizontal lines. And you can see one or two pink pixels in each sections.
