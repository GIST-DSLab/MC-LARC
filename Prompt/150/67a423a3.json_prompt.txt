- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...create a yellow square around the point where the two lines meet.

2. To make the output, you have to...paint a red circle over the spot where the two lines intersect.

3. To make the output, you have to...draw a blue triangle at the end of the two lines.

4. To make the output, you have to...put a violet line through the point where the two lines overlap.

5. To make the output, you have to...place a green rectangle on the point where the three lines intersect.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...two different color lines of different colors intersecting, one vertically and one horizontally. One line is overlapped by another lines.
