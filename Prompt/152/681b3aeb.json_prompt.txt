2. To make the output, you have to...piece the two shapes together to form a rectangular section.

3. To make the output, you have to...round the edges of the shapes into a circular format. 

4. To make the output, you have to...align the shapes to form a zigzag pattern.

5. To make the output, you have to...flip the shapes to form an inverted structure. 

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
