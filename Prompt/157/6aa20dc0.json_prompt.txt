- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...color the grid as per the shape of unique shape.

2. To make the output, you have to...remove the unique shape from the grid.

3. To make the output, you have to...sort the grid items in a numerical order.

4. To make the output, you have to...fill the grid with any color you choose.

5. To make the output, you have to...outline the shape instead of coloring it in the grid.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a complete shape. In the diagonally opposite corners of this shape, there are two squares with different colors. These squarese with different colors are repeated in the same color and position relationship elsewhere or scaled up and repeates.
