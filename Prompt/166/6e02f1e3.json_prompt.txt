- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...place varying numbers of grey rectangles based on the dominant color in the input grid.

2. To make the output, you have to...put 2 grey circles on the corners of the grid depending on the shade variations in the input grid.

3. To make the output, you have to...align 5 blue boxes in a vertical line if there are more than 4 colors in the input grid.

4. To make the output, you have to...place 4 black boxes at random spots based on how dense the patterns are on the input grid.

5. To make the output, you have to...place 3 grey boxes in various spots based on how many colors there are in the input grid. If there is one color, put 3 grey boxes on the top of the grid. If there are two colors, place a diagonal line of grey boxes form top left to bottom right. If there are 3 colors, place a diagonal line of grey boxes going from bottom left to top right.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a 3x3 grid that may have between 1 and 3 colors.
