- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...shuffle the colored pixels randomly throughout the grid. Ignore the exemplars.

2. To make the output, you have to...rotate the entire input grid by 90 degrees. Do not modify the color or positions of the singletons.

3. To make the output, you have to...remove the singletons from the input grid. Leave the pixels unchanged.

4. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid. Add colored pixels to the singletons such that they copy the exemplars.

5. To make the output, you have to...invert the colors of every pixel in the grid. Do not use the exemplars as a reference.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...the completed shape of the object. Also, you can also see the elements that make up a part of it.
