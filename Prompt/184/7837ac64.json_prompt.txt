- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...fill the same color make square by four corners.

2. To make the output, you have to...paint the circle with a different hue.

3. To make the output, you have to...connect the five dots with one line.

4. To make the output, you have to...fill the rhombus using three contrasting shades.

5. To make the output, you have to...draw a rectangle with two sides parallel.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...multiple black squares of equal size created by vertical and horizontal lines. At the intersection points of these vertical and horizontal lines, there are pixels of a different color, occupying all the corners of single black square.
