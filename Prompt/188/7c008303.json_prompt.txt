- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...fill in the grid with an array of colors from the 2x2 grid. You then have to recreate the brown design shown in the input grid using the same colors. The colors must be placed alternately across the 4 3x3 grids. If the upper left square in the input pair is gray, then the design in the upper left 3x3 grid should be gray. Repeat the color blocks randomly for the other 3x3 areas.

2. To make the output, you have to...start with an empty grid. You then need to divide the grid into multiple smaller grids, and fill each of them with a different color from the 2x2 grid following the pattern in the blue design from the input. Each smaller grid will be 4x4, and the color of each smaller grid correlates with the lower left square in the input pair.

3. To make the output, you have to...fill in the entire grid with white. You then need to use the colors from the 2x2 grid to make a mirrored image of the red design shown in the input grid. Colors must be placed randomly across the 4 3x3 grids. The upper right square doesn't correlate with any specific color. Repeat the color blocks randomly for the other 3x3 areas.

4. To make the output, you have to...fill in the complete grid with green. You then have to use different shades of green to replicate the design shown in the input grid. No 2x2 area should be of the same shade and each area will be a 5x5 grid. The color of the lower right square in the input pair does not influence the output.

5. To make the output, you have to...fill in the entire grid with black. You then need to use each of the colors from the 2x2 grid to make the same design as the green design shown in the input grid. The colors must be in the same area shown in the 2x2 area. Each area will be a 3x3 grid, so there are a total of 4 3x3 grids. If the upper right square in the input pair is pink, then the design in the upper right 3x3 grid should be pink. Repeat the color blocks for the other 3x3 areas.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a grid with one light blue row and column. There is a one-colored design in one area and a multi-colored 2x2 grid in another area.
