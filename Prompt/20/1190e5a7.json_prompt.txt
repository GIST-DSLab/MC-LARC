- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...change the color of the grid to the color of the input grid not the lines. You need to adjust the number and positions of sections divided by lines of different colors horizontally and vertically according to the grid size.

2. To make the output, you have to...remove all colored lines and rearrange the grid number and positions without concern for color matching.

3. To make the output, you have to...adjust only the positions of sections divided by lines; color changes and grid sizes are irrelevant.

4. To make the output, you have to...maintain the original color of the grid with zero amendments and arrange colored lines according to the grid size.

5. To make the output, you have to...alter both the grid and line colors to match the input grid, disregarding the size and section adjustments.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a colored grid with vertical and horizontal lines.
