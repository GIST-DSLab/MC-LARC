- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...draw circles with an even number grid OUTSIDE the green border with blue, and the rest (4x4, 7x7, 9x9) circles with the color you get from brown.

2. To make the output, you have to...fill the squares with an even number grid INSIDE the blue border with red, and the rest (1x1, 3x3, 5x5) squares with the color you get from orange.

3. To make the output, you have to...fill the squares with an odd number grid INSIDE the yellow border with purple, and the rest (6x6, 8x8, 10x10) squares with the color you get from lime.

4. To make the output, you have to...fill the squares with an even number grid OUTSIDE the pink border with yellow, and the rest (2x2, 6x6, 8x8) squares with the color you get from purple.

5. To make the output, you have to...paint the triangles with an odd number grid INSIDE the black border with green, and the rest (3x3, 5x5, 7x7) triangles with the color you get from blue.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...several blue square borders.
