- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...manipulate the square to form an outline frame. Create a zigzag path that intersects the monochrome dots.

2. To make the output, you have to...transform the triangle into a pyramid shape. Construct a curvy line that meets the negative space.

3. To make the output, you have to...morph the ellipse to use as a contour guide. Formulate a straight line that overlaps the grayscale pixel.

4. To make the output, you have to...adjust the circle into a hexagonal boundary. Subsequently, draw the diagonal line crossing at the points of intersection.

5. To make the output, you have to...replicate the rectangle to be a background grid. Then make the vertical and horizontal line that crosses at the color pixel.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a rectangle grid within a large grid. Around the rectangle, there are a lot of random colored pixels. The single colored grid will contain some other color of pixel or pixels.
