- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... copy the input grid, then copy the exact same pattern to fill in the whole black background.

2. To make the output, you have to... turn the input grid upside down, then utilize an opposing scheme to fill in the whole black background.

3. To make the output, you have to... ignore the input grid, then randomly distribute objects to fill in the whole black background.

4. To make the output, you have to... change the color of the input grid, then design a different pattern to fill in the whole black background.

5. To make the output, you have to... delete the input grid, then remove everything to fill in the whole black background.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a pattern of one color with the same shape repeating.
