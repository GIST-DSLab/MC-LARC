- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...alter the shape's size to the grid's size and maintain the original colors.

2. To make the output, you have to...reset the grid's settings and the two colors are different from the shape.

3. To make the output, you have to...ensure the shape is smaller than the grid and mix up the two colors.

4. To make the output, you have to...make the grid the same size as the shape and the two colors are just like in the shape.

5. To make the output, you have to...downsize the grid to match the shape, but the colors don't need to be the same.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...several blue rectangles on a black background. Inside of the blue rectangles, you can see the red pixels. The red pixels are separated from each other.
