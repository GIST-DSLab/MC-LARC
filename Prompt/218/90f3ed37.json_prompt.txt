- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... finish the line so that it is the same as the top line but finish the line in dark blue.

2. To make the output, you have to... complete the line so that it conflicts the bottom line but complete the line in green.

3. To make the output, you have to... start the line so that it is different from the bottom line but start the line in light blue.

4. To make the output, you have to... begin the line so that it is similar to the middle line but begin the line in red.

5. To make the output, you have to... finish the line so that it is contrary to the top line but finish the line in black.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a complete line pattern running from left to right, at the top of the grid. Below that, there are a few incomplete short line patterns.
