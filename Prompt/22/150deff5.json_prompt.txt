- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...leave the pattern unfilled and only outline it with the blue and red colors. 

2. To make the output, you have to...fill the pattern randomly with all the 9 colors available.

3. To make the output, you have to...fill in pattern completely with blue and red, to form 2x2 blue pattern and 1x3 red patterns.

4. To make the output, you have to...fill in the pattern completely with green and yellow, to form 2x2 green pattern and 1x3 yellow patterns.

5. To make the output, you have to...fill in pattern completely with a single-color, pink.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...several objects with gray pixels and some other color pixels.
