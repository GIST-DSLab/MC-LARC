- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...keep the same color and pattern but reduce it to a 3x3 grid. Each tile in the input grid is a 3x3 grid pattern on the output.

2. To make the output, you have to...maintain the same color and pattern but increase to a 12x12 grid. Each tile in the input grid is a 5x5 grid pattern on the output.

3. To make the output, you have to...change the color and pattern to a 9x9 grid. Each tile in the input grid is a 3x3 grid pattern on the output.

4. To make the output, you have to...keep same color and pattern but increase to a 9x9 grid. Each tile in the input grid is a 3x3 grid pattern on the output.

5. To make the output, you have to...alter the color and pattern and increase it to a 5x5 grid. Each tile in the input grid is a 3x3 grid pattern on the output.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...3x3 grid with random color pattern.
