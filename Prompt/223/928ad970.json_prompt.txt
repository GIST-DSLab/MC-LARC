- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... edit the input grid. Then, using the color of the colored rectangle, make the average rectangle possible that will be located outside the four grey dots. The outside of the new rectangle should touch the outside of all four grey dots.

2. To make the output, you have to... copy the input grid. Then, using the color of the colored rectangle, make the largest rectangle possible that will fit inside the four grey dots. The outside of the new rectangle should touch the inside of all four grey dots.

3. To make the output, you have to... interpret the input grid. Then, without using the color of the colored rectangle, make the circular shape possible that will fit within the four grey dots. The outside of the new shape should not touch the inside of all four grey dots.

4. To make the output, you have to... discard the input grid. Then, excluding the color of the colored rectangle, make the thinnest rectangle possible that will not fit inside the four grey dots. The outside of the new rectangle should overlap the outside of all four grey dots.

5. To make the output, you have to... ignore the input grid. Then, using the color of the colored rectangle, make the smallest rectangle possible that will fit inside the four grey dots. The outside of the new rectangle should avoid touching the inside of all four grey dots.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see... 4 grey pixels and a colored rectangle border within the pixels.
