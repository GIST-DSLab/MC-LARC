- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...maneuver the blue cylinders towards the cylindrical places marked on the giant green tapestry with the rainbow fragments also.

2. To make the output, you have to...adjust the yellow circles to the large squares on the blue surface with the transparencies attached.

3. To make the output, you have to...insert the green triangles into the major hexagons aligned on the expansive white plane with the grayscale pieces too.

4. To make the output, you have to...arrange the black lines onto the minimal points designated on the vast purple field with the grayscale shapes simultaneously.

5. To make the output, you have to...fit the red blocks in the small grid blocks where they go on the large red grid with the colored blocks as well.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a red grid with black blocks missing. As well as 3x3 small grid blocks with red blocks that fit the black blocks in the large red grid.
