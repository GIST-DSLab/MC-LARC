- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... shrink the dimensions of the squares that form a ceiling to the other pattern. You scatter the patterns by reducing the size of the pattern that is identical to the shrunken square.

2. To make the output, you have to... resize the square shapes that border another pattern. You align the patterns by readjusting the pattern that matches the resized square.

3. To make the output, you have to... remove the colored squares that create a floor to the other pattern. you bring the patterns together by moving the pattern that is the same color as the line you remove

4. To make the output, you have to... rotate the squares that connect to another pattern. You merge the patterns by spinning the pattern that is similar to the rotating square.

5. To make the output, you have to... change the colors of the squares that create a boundary to the other pattern. You separate the patterns by swapping the pattern that is the same color as the perimeter square.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...two rectangles of different colors. The two rectangles are connected by a single line of the same color as one of the rectangles.
