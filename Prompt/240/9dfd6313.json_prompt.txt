- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...rotate the pattern 180 degrees to the left and keep it as it is. The output should be a rotated version of the input.

2. To make the output, you have to...shrink the pattern to half of its original size and fill the empty space. The output should be a condensed version of the input.

3. To make the output, you have to...stretch the pattern to twice its original size and keep it as it is. The output should be an enlarged version of the input.

4. To make the output, you have to...rotate the pattern 90 degrees to the right and then flip it over to it's reverse. the output should be an 90 degrees mirror image of the input.

5. To make the output, you have to...invert the pattern's colors and then rotate it 45 degrees. The output should be an inverted and slightly rotated image of the input.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...two sections divided by a gray diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right. There are some colored pixels in the left bottom section.
