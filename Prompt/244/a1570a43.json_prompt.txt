- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... treat the 4 pixels like a racing track. Drive the random shape around the track until it reaches the finish line.

2. To make the output, you have to... think of the 4 pixels as a picture frame. Reposition the random shape to be centered in that frame.

3. To make the output, you have to... imagine the 4 pixels as a game board. Rotate the random shape to fit perfectly on the board.

4. To make the output, you have to... consider the 4 pixels as a volume button. Amplify the size of the random shape to match that button.

5. To make the output, you have to... view the 4 pixels as a computer keyboard. Rescale the dimensions of the random shape to match the keyboard keys.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a black grid with 4 pixels evenly spaced from each other to create a sort of square and a different colored collection of pixels that create a random shape.
