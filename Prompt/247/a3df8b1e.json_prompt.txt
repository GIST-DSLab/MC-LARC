- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...create a green dot in the middle, draw green dots diagonally down to the right until the edge, then draw green dots horizontally to the left until the other side, repeat until the bottom is reached.

2. To make the output, you have to...draw a pink dot one to the right and one down from the original one, follow this pattern until the center, then scatter pink dots throughout the remaining area.

3. To make the output, you have to...start by drawing a red dot in the center, then draw two red dots to the right and two down, continue this pattern until the bottom right corner is reached.

4. To make the output, you have to...draw a blue dot one to the right and one up from the original one, follow that pattern until you reach the side, then draw a blue dot one to the left and one up until you reach the other side, repeat until you reach the top.

5. To make the output, you have to...draw a yellow dot two to the left and two down from the original one, then mirror this shape on the right hand side, repeat until you reach the bottom.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a single blue pixel at the bottom left corner.
