- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...move the existing pattern to a different section. The area next to the pattern should remain blank.

2. To make the output, you have to...design a completely new pattern in the empty section. The two patterns should be entirely different.

3. To make the output, you have to...erase the existing pattern and leave the section empty. There should be a clear space next to the pattern.

4. To make the output, you have to...alter the original pattern in small ways for the new section. The two patterns should be slightly different.

5. To make the output, you have to...copy the pattern exactly to the new empty section. There should be two of the same pattern side-by-side.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a random pattern with various color pixels.
