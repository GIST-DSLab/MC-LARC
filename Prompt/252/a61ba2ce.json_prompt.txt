- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...follow the colored pattern and put them on all the corners exactly how the pattern is placed. Then fill in the middle 4 squares with black.

2. To make the output, you have to...use the grayscale pattern and put them in random positions. Then fill in the middle 4 squares with white.

3. To make the output, you have to...follow an inverted version of the colored pattern, placing it on the sides. Then color the middle square with black.

4. To make the output, you have to...ignore the colored pattern and put them on all the corners however you like. Then leave the middle 4 squares empty.

5. To make the output, you have to...scatter the colors without any pattern, placing them in the center. Then color the 4 corner squares with black.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...four patterns, each composed of three pixels of different colors, but they have the same shape when rotated.
