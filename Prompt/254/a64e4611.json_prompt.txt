- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...replace the black grid with red and pair with a blue grid.

2. To make the output, you have to...empty the black grid entirely and leave it without any colour.

3. To make the output, you have to...cover the entire grid with blue, ignoring the original black grid.

4. To make the output, you have to...draw a yellow circle around the black grid, not filling it with any colour.

5. To make the output, you have to...fill the black grid with green surrounding with continue black grid.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a thick black horizontal and vertical line intersecting to form a certain shape. The surrounding area is filled with random pixels of a single color.
