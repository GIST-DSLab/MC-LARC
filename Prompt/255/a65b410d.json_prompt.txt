- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...detach the red, green, and blue bars from each other. The green bar should decrease in length by one square each time it moves up, while the blue bar should increase in length each time it moves away from the red bar.

2. To make the output, you have to...copy your red input boxes to the output grid. And then, you need to add green bars above the red bar and blue bars below it, all attached to the left side. Furthermore, the green bar should increase in length by one square each time it moves up from the red bar, while the blue bar should decrease in length by one square each time it moves away from the red bar. The green bar continues this process all the way up to the top of the grid, while the blue bar repeats until it becomes one square in length.

3. To make the output, you have to...swap the positions of the red and green bars while keeping the blue bar consistent. The length of the bars should remain the same throughout the process.

4. To make the output, you have to...align the red, green, and blue bars at the top of the grid. The green and blue bars should remain the same length while the red bar incrementally decreases in length.

5. To make the output, you have to...move the red input boxes to the right side of the grid. The green bar should remain the same length across the grid, while the blue bar should change in length randomly each time it moves away from the red bar.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a black grid with a small horizontal line in red. The red horizontal bar is attached to the left side.
