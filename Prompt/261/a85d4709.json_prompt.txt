- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...check the position of the grey pixels. Where the grey pixel is in the first column, the corresponding pixels in that raw in the output should have color red. If the pixel is in the middle column, the corresponding pixels in the output should be yellow. Where the grey pixel is in the the last column , the corresponding pixel in that raw in the output should be green.

2. To make the output, you have to...check the image's grayscale intensity. Light gray results in red pixels, medium gray corresponds to yellow pixels, and dark gray gives you green pixels in the resulting image.

3. To make the output, you have to...measure the size of each grey pixel and arrange accordingly. Small pixels should be displayed as red, medium-sized pixels as yellow, and large pixels as green in the output image.

4. To make the output, you have to...create a new layer for each color. Assign red to the bottom layer, yellow to the middle layer, and green to the top layer. The grey pixel column does not affect the output color.

5. To make the output, you have to...change the grey pixels according to their sequences. The first pixel should be red, the second pixel should be yellow, and the third pixel should be green, regardless of their location on the grid.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see.. in each row of 3x3 grid, some grey pixels either in the first column, second or third column.
