- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to....generate a new grid using the least used color on the current 3x3 square.

2. To make the output, you have to....designate an area where the red pixels dominate the most in the input grid.

3. To make the output, you have to....spread all pixels evenly across the grid, with blue pixels prioritized.

4. To make the output, you have to....replicate every green pixel from the 3x3 square that has the most yellow pixels in the input grid.

5. To make the output, you have to....copy the 3x3 square from the input grid that has the most blue pixels.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...four 3x3 squares with blue and light blue pixels.
