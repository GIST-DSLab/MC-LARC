- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... rotate the input grid 90 degrees and color the single squares green.

2. To make the output, you have to... copy the input grid. Any shapes which only contain one single square should be colored blue.

3. To make the output, you have to... copy the input grid, and color all the single squares yellow.

4. To make the output, you have to... mirror the input grid and color the single squares red.

5. To make the output, you have to... replicate the input grid, color all the single squares blue, and double squares gray.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...shapes made up of multiple pixels and shapes made up of only one pixel.
