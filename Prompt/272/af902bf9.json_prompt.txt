- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...place green in the corner of the blue triangle structure, but not directly adjacent to any of the blue triangles.

2. To make the output, you have to...put red in the middle of the yellow square structure, but not actually next to any of the yellow squares.

3. To make the output, you have to...keep white within the brown pentagon structure, but not immediately near any of the brown pentagons.

4. To make the output, you have to...lay black at the center of the pink hexagon structure, but not directly next to any of the pink hexagons.

5. To make the output, you have to...set purple amongst the orange circle structure, but not directly touching any of the orange circles.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see....4 or 8 yellow pixels in a square form.
