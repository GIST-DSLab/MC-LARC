- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...replace each of colored grid by light blue color grid pattern.

2. To make the output, you have to...darken the hue of each colored grid square.

3. To make the output, you have to...remove all the colored grids from the pattern.

4. To make the output, you have to...increase the size of each grid square.

5. To make the output, you have to...change the grid pattern to stripes.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...two sections, left and right. One section has a pattern made up of light blue pixels, and the other section has a pattern made up of various colors.
