- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... maintain the color of the intersection, keeping it the same as the input grid. 

2. To make the output, you have to... switch the colors of the entire grid randomly. 

3. To make the output, you have to... remove the intersection of the two lines completely. 

4. To make the output, you have to... copy the input grid. In the output, change the color where the two lines meet so that the other color line is on top.

5. To make the output, you have to... swap the colors of the intersecting lines with each other.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see... two colored lines intersecting. One line is overlapped by the other line.
