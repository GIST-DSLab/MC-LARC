- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... imagine you are squishing the original grid horizontally and vertically. The colored dots move and overlap on top of the background.

2. To make the output, you have to... pull the original grid outward on all sides. The colored dots disperse into the background. 

3. To make the output, you have to... tilt the original grid at different angles. The colored dots roll off the background.

4. To make the output, you have to... shake the original grid back and forth. The colored dots scatter across the background.

5. To make the output, you have to... rotate the original grid in a spiral motion. The colored dots stay stationary on the background.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a random pattern made up of one color in a 2x2 grid, in each corner of the black background. It is not necessarily present.
