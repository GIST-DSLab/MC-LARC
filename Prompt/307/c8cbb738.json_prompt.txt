- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...place all the groups of pixels on top of each other keeping all colors the same. Leave any left over blocks the color of the original background.

2. To make the output, you have to...scatter all groups of pixels across the image, making sure their colors are different. Recolor any left over blocks with the brightest color available.

3. To make the output, you have to...stack the groups of pixels neatly next to each other, altering the color with each layer. Fill any left over blocks with random color patterns.

4. To make the output, you have to...arrange all the pixels within a single layer and change their color to grayscale. Discard any left over blocks not fitting in.

5. To make the output, you have to...redistribute the groups of pixels randomly without caring about the color. Leave any left over blocks transparent.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a solid color background with multiple groups of 4 colored pixels.
