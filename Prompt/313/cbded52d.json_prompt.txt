- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...only focus on the middle block and disregard the alignment of the end blocks.

2. To make the output, you have to...randomly distribute the blocks on each row without any pattern.

3. To make the output, you have to...make each across and down row identical, matching the middle block in each row to the end blocks.

4. To make the output, you have to...make each across and down row different, ignoring the middle block in each row.

5. To make the output, you have to...connect the first and last blocks, leaving the middle blocks unattended.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...nine 2x2 blue sections made up of black horizontal and vertical lines. Some of the 2x2 blue grids contain pixels of different colors.
