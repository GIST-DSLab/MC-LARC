- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...start from the bottom left of the input grid and transfer the colored squares to the output grid from right to left. The remaining squares in the output grid will be black.

2. To make the output, you have to...arrange the colors in a random pattern on the output grid, disregarding their original order and positioning on the input grid. The remaining squares in the output grid will be left blank.

3. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid colored squares directly onto the output grid maintaining their original positioning. Anything unfilled will be black. 

4. To make the output, you have to...move the colors from the right-most column of the input grid to the left-most column of the output grid one by one from top to bottom. Then repeat the process with the next column rightward on the input grid. The remaining squares in the output grid will be black.

5. To make the output, you have to...follow the input grid colored squares from left to right. The left most color will be in the top left. The next colored square will to to the right. Each colored square will get its own square in the output. Continue this until you reach the top right corner of the output grid size. Then the next colored square will go under the top right and then they will fill in output grid to the left until it reaches the left edge. Then the it will go below that and continue to the right again. Do this until all of the colored squares from the input grid are used. The remaining squares in the output grid will be black.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...colored pixels that are scattered across the grid.
