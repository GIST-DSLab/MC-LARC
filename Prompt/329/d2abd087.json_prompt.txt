- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...rotate the input grid counterclockwise by 90 degrees, then replace all the gray squares with black squares.

2. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid. Then count how many gray squares make up each of the individual shapes. If the shape uses (6) gray squares, change those gray squares to red. If the shape has any other number of gray squares, change the gray squares to blue.

3. To make the output, you have to...leave the gray squares as they are, and instead focus on changing the white squares to blue or red.

4. To make the output, you have to...erase all the squares from the input grid, and then redraw the entire grid from scratch.

5. To make the output, you have to...identify the shapes made from green squares. If the shape uses (6) green squares, turn it yellow. If it uses a different number of green squares, turn it purple.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...several objects with gray color.
