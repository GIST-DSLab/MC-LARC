- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...replace all horizontal stripes with vertical stripes and all vertical stripes with horizontal stripes. Everything else keep the same as input.

2. To make the output, you have to...change all gray squares to light blue and all light blue squares to gray. Everything else keep the same as input.

3. To make the output, you have to...invert all dark shapes to light and all light shapes to dark. Everything else keep the same as input.

4. To make the output, you have to...switch all the large stars to small stars and all the small stars to large stars. Everything else keep the same as input.

5. To make the output, you have to...change all red circles to green and all green circles to red. Everything else keep the same as input.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...random color pattern.
