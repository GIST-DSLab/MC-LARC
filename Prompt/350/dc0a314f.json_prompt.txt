- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...recite the entire periodic table from memory.

2. To make the output, you have to...write a program in Python to solve the Rubik's cube.

3. To make the output, you have to...paint the green square to match the patten of the mosaic, like the missing puzzle piece.

4. To make the output, you have to...bake a cherry pie from scratch, following a grandmother's handwritten recipe.

5. To make the output, you have to...construct a model out of toothpicks, replicating the Eiffel Tower.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a radial symmetrical pattern made up of various colored pixels. However, some of it is obscured by a 5x5 green grid.
