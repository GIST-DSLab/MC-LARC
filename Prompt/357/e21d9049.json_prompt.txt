- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...continue the lines to all edges, using alternating the color pattern.

2. To make the output, you have to...erase all the lines and restart with a different color range.

3. To make the output, you have to...use a single solid color to fill the space, ignoring the edges.

4. To make the output, you have to...subtract the lines from all edges, using the same color scheme.

5. To make the output, you have to...cut out the lines from the middle, not worrying about following a color pattern.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...two lines of various colors, but with the same pattern. One is vertical and the other is horizontal. They are intersecting at the same color of single pixel.
