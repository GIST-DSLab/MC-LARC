- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...push all blocks towards the left till they hit the gray line which will act as a barrier. None of the blocks will pass beyond this line.

2. To make the output, you have to...rotate the blocks by 90 degrees to the right side, using the gray line as the axis. This will create a mirrored effect.

3. To make the output, you have to...pull out the blocks from the right side of the gray line so that they align perfectly with the left side. There should be no overlapping of blocks.

4. To make the output, you have to...clear all blocks and start from scratch, taking the gray line as a guide. Any blocks that cross the gray line will disappear.

5. To make the output, you have to...fill in the blocks as if you have folded the right side directly over the left side, taking the gray line out.. The blocks directly beside of the gray line will overlap.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...the gray vertical line which divided the 10x10 grid into two 10x4 grids in the center. Each section contains pixels composed of two different colors.
