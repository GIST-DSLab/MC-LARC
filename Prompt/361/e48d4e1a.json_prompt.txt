- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...count the grey grid and place the meeting point of the colored grid-down through with the same count.

2. To make the output, you have to...calculate the circumference of the grey grid and locate the intersection of the colored grid-down with the same calculation.

3. To make the output, you have to...measure the distance of the grey grid and position the highest point of the colored grid-down with the same measurement.

4. To make the output, you have to...count the steps between grid points and place the central point of the colored grid-up through with the different count.

5. To make the output, you have to...identify the color of the grid and locate the lower section of the colored grid-up with the equal identification.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...two intersecting lines. And you should see a number of grey pixels at the right upper corner.
