- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...detect similar patterns between pink triangles and orange diamonds, and turn all the orange diamonds into pink.

2. To make the output, you have to...detect any green circle clones of the red square patterns and modify the green circles to squares.

3. To make the output, you have to...find any black squares that are in the same pattern as the red squares, then change the black squares in each pattern to red.

4. To make the output, you have to...find any red circles that are in the same pattern as the square ones, then transform the circles to triangles.

5. To make the output, you have to...exchange the blue rectangles for yellow diamonds, if they fit the same design as the blue ones.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...several random gray and black pixels on a grid and one distinct pattern of red pixels.
