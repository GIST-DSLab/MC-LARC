- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...change the single black pixels to green, two black pixel lines to red, and three black pixel shapes to blue. The background stays gray.

2. To make the output, you have to...change the single yellow pixels to blue, two green pixel lines to brown, and three white pixel shapes to black. The background stays red.

3. To make the output, you have to...change the single red pixels to purple, two green pixel lines to orange, and three blue pixel shapes to yellow. The background stays black.

4. To make the output, you have to...change the single pink pixels to white, two brown pixel lines to teal, and three black pixel shapes to orange. The background stays green.

5. To make the output, you have to...change the single green pixels to red, two purple pixel lines to black, and three gray pixel shapes to white. The background stays yellow.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a 10x10 black and gray grid.
