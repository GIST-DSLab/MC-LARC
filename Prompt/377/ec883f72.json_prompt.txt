- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...add diagonal lines extending from each corner of the outer squares to the edge of the output grid.

2. To make the output, you have to...fill in every square on the grid.

3. To make the output, you have to...remove all lines from the outer squares.

4. To make the output, you have to...draw circles around the corner of each outer square.

5. To make the output, you have to...overlap the grids onto one another.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a part of square with a differently colored center.
