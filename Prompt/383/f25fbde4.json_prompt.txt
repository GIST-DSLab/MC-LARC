- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...double pattern and fit the resulting pattern to scale. If it's 1x5 the result should be 2x10.

2. To make the output, you have to...leave the pattern as it is and fit the resulting pattern to scale. If it's 1x5 the result should remain 1x5.

3. To make the output, you have to...increase the pattern by a factor of three and fit the resulting pattern to scale. If it's 1x5 the result should be 3x15.

4. To make the output, you have to...decrease the pattern by a factor of four and fit the resulting pattern to scale. If it's 1x5 the result should be 0.25x1.25.

5. To make the output, you have to...halve the pattern and fit the resulting pattern to scale. If it's 1x5 the result should be 0.5x2.5.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a black grid with a yellow pattern.
