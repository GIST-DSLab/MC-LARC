- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...overlap the blue and yellow in a 6x4 rectangle. Paint each pink square in red. Replace the previous pattern with a white one. You should only have red squares.

2. To make the output, you have to...mix the brown and white in a way that they form a 3x2 board. Fill up the remaining vacant patches with yellow. Replace the past design with a new brown one. You should only see yellow patches.

3. To make the output, you have to...keep the orange and grey separately and fill them in a 5x2 space. Fill each white octagon with purple. Remove the old pattern completely. You should only have purple spaces.

4. To make the output, you have to...merge the pink and violet to form a shape that occupies a 2x2 area. Fill the existing white circles with blue. Create a new pattern with orange. There should only be blue circles.

5. To make the output, you have to...combine the orange and grey into one pattern that take up a 4x3 space. Fill each black space with green. Fill the old pattern with black. You should only have green spaces.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a left part of random pattern of orange, a blue vertical line in the middle, a right part of random pattern of grey.
