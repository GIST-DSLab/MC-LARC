- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:

2. To make the output, you have to... alter the temperature from cold to warm, then prepare the ingredients, with the same measurements and order.

3. To make the output, you have to... change the background color from black to light gray, then continue the pattern of lines, with the same spacing and bends.

4. To make the output, you have to... adjust the room lighting from dim to bright, then arrange the furniture, with the same gaps and orientation.

5. To make the output, you have to... modify the font size from small to large, then repeat the text, with the same indentation and style.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
