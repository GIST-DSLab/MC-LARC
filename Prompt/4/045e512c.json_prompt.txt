- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... invert the color palette of the remaining cubes, clustering them at the center of the grid without any resemblance to the reference shape.

2. To make the output, you have to... randomize the color arrangement of the grid and purposely avoid replicating any recognizable shape or pattern seen before.

3. To make the output, you have to... construct a completely new shape in the grid using opposing colors, disregarding any pre-existing pattern or start point.

4. To make the output, you have to... erase the reference shape, using the color of the other blocks as a guide, before expanding to the edge of the grid with an unrelated pattern.

5. To make the output, you have to... replicate the reference shape, using the color of the other blocks as a start point and then replicate that pattern to the edge of the grid, even if it needs a incomplete shape.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a reference shape, which will be the shape with the most blocks, with various colored blocks to its sides.
