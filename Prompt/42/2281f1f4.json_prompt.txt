- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...draw the red squares first, without any regard to the grey squares. X and Y intersections are not significant here.

2. To make the output, you have to...wait until the grey squares turn red naturally. There's no need to treat or paint them. Just wait and they will morph into the desired redness.

3. To make the output, you have to...observe X and Y grey squares and place tiny dots on the intersection points. Only after marking the spots, you transform them into red squares.

4. To make the output, you have to...cover all the grey squares with red paint. No distinction between X or Y is necessary, red is applied equally everywhere.

5. To make the output, you have to...use the grey squares as reference to make red squares. The grey squares on the top are X, the grey squares on the right side are Y. Imagine a line that will intersect from X and Y squares. At that spot paint a black square red.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...several gray pixels located on the upper and right sides.
