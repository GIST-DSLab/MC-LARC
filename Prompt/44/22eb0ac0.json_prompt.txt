- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to....ignore the color of the blocks entirely and fill in the horizontal row with a random color.

2. To make the output, you have to....flip the input vertically. If two blocks on the same vertical line are the same color, fill in the rest of that line with that color. Disregard the blocks on the same line that are different colors.

3. To make the output, you have to....copy the input. If two blocks across from each other are the same color, fill in the rest of that horizontal row with that color. Don't do anything with the blocks across from each other that are different colors

4. To make the output, you have to....erase every line that has two blocks with different colors. If two blocks across from each other are the same color, do not change anything with that horizontal row.

5. To make the output, you have to....alternate the colors in each row. If two blocks across from each other are the same color, change the rest of the row to a different color. If the blocks across from each other are different colors, leave it as is.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...several single pixels on both sides which are arranged with one space in between them. The pixels on both sides are facing each other horizontally.
