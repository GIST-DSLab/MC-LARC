- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...take the smaller color and shoot it out the top.

2. To make the output, you have to...consume the brighter tone and release it from the rear.

3. To make the output, you have to...grasp the dimmer shade and push it down the middle.

4. To make the output, you have to...swallow the larger color and hide it in the bottom.

5. To make the output, you have to...melt the less vibrant hue and drain it through the side.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a single pattern in the shape of a triangle, and there is one pixel of a different color in the middle of the base of the triangle.
