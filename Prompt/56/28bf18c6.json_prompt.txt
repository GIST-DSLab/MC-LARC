- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...invert the pattern diagonally.

2. To make the output, you have to...copy the same pattern into two times in a row.

3. To make the output, you have to...rotate the pattern 90 degrees clockwise.

4. To make the output, you have to...enlarge the pattern by doubling both the height and the width.

5. To make the output, you have to...replace the original pattern with the negative version.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a structure of colored blocks in a random shape.
