- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...invert the colors of all squares that are one square deep, creating an outline along the grid.

2. To make the output, you have to...color all the squares that are only two deep from the outside edge using pink color.

3. To make the output, you have to...remove all squares that are one square deep and place them in a circular pattern.

4. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid into the output. Around the outside of the grid, you will notice some squares are only one square deep around. Take note of these squares. Using green, draw straight lines horizontally and vertically from these squares that are only one deep around the outside, connecting them only to squares on the other side of the grid that also are only one square deep.

5. To make the output, you have to...immediately draw a diagonal line across the grid connecting the corners.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...the boundary of the grid filled with continuous light blue or red pixels, while the central part is empty with a black background.
