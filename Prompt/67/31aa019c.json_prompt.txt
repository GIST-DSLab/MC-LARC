- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...begin with a blank grid then randomly place the blocks of bright red-orange color around the edges of the grid.

2. To make the output, you have to...create an inverted mirror image of the input grid using only blocks of black color.

3. To make the output, you have to....make the entire output grid black. then find the block in the input grid that is the only one of that color and place it in the same position in the output grid. Then surround that block with blocks of the bright red color

4. To make the output, you have to...create a checkerboard pattern using black and bright red-orange blocks based on the positioning of the blocks in the input grid.

5. To make the output, you have to...swap the positions of the black and red-orange blocks in the input grid to create the output.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a large grid with many colored pixels.
