- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... add more solid colored patterns, while maintaining the original multi-colored pattern and replacing its color with green tiles.

2. To make the output, you have to... keep the solid colored patterns but alter each pattern's colors. After that, you should also add some white tiles in the multi-colored pattern.

3. To make the output, you have to... take away the solid colored patterns and substitute them with grayscale variations, then modify the original multi-colored pattern with blue tiles.

4. To make the output, you have to... replace the solid colored patterns with the multi-colored versions, so each pattern has the same coloring. Then remove the original multi-colored pattern by replacing it entirely with black tiles.

5. To make the output, you have to... include an additional four-color pattern to complement the solid colored patterns and then swap them out randomly.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see... a black grid with patterns placed thought it. One will be multi-colored, and the others will be a solid color.
