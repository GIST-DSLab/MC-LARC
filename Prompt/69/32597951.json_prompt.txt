- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...replace the blue squares with green squares to complete a square of a rectangle with the light blue blocks

2. To make the output, you have to...collect the blue squares and stack them next to yellow blocks

3. To make the output, you have to...replace all light blue blocks with green squares to form a row

4. To make the output, you have to...turn the green squares into blue squares to form a triangle with the blue blocks

5. To make the output, you have to...combine red squares and blue squares to get squares of orange blocks.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see... blue pixels and light blue pixels. And you can make rectangle composed with light blue pixels and blue pixels.
