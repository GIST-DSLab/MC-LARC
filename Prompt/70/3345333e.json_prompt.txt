- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...redistribute the pattern boxes evenly within the single color pattern.

2. To make the output, you have to...increase the number of pattern boxes in the single color pattern.

3. To make the output, you have to...change the color of the existing pattern box.

4. To make the output, you have to...remove the unnecessary pattern box in the single color pattern

5. To make the output, you have to...resize the pattern box in the single color pattern.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a single color pattern with unnecessary square box in the middle or touch in the single color pattern
