- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...slide the orange hexagons six steps diagonally, with the background steadfastly green.

2. To make the output, you have to...let the green triangles ascend four blocks upwards, while keeping the background wholly grey.

3. To make the output, you have to...take the blue dots and place them two squares down, with the background still fully black.

4. To make the output, you have to...shift the red circles three spaces left, leaving the background a complete white.

5. To make the output, you have to...move the yellow stars five cells to the right, maintaining an entirely purple background.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a gray baseline at the bottom, and above it. There may or may not be gray pixels. If there are gray pixels, you can see single blue pixel above them.
