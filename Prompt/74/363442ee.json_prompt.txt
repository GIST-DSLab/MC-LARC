- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...use the blue square as the middle square and recreate the same pattern replacing the blue square with the same color in the middle as the pattern

2. To make the output, you have to...reverse the entire pattern and place the blue square in the center

3. To make the output, you have to...only select and swap the blue square from the pattern

4. To make the output, you have to...remove the blue square out of the pattern and start again

5. To make the output, you have to...randomly change the colors of the square in the pattern, including the blue one

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a 3x3 color pattern on the left side of vertical gray line and blue pixels on the right side of vertical gray line.
