- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...perceive the red grid as a cuboid, transform the overlapping areas to orange, and keep the original properties of the other grids unchanged

2. To make the output, you have to...replace the grid with a hexagonal shape, then fill its area with blue color, and keep the rest grids in the original color

3. To make the output, you have to...identify circles in the red grid, then convert all interior grids to green, and maintain consistency in all other grids 

4. To make the output, you have to...assume the red grid as a rectangle or square , now complete the structure by change the overlap color into yellow, leave all others grid same as input

5. To make the output, you have to...visualize the red grid as a triangle, transform the intersection color into violet, and keep the remaining color properties of other grids intact

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a random pattern in one color and several dense red pixels.
