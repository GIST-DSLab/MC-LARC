- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...avoid connecting any of the 2x2 grids of the same color.

2. To make the output, you have to...leave the black 2x2 square grid empty between the two same colors.

3. To make the output, you have to...fill the black 2x2 square grid with same color in between the two same color of 2x2 grid and connect.

4. To make the output, you have to...fill the black 2x2 square grid with a different color between two same color grids.

5. To make the output, you have to...disconnect the 2x2 square grids of the same color.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...cubes painted in different colors and empty black cubes between the colored grid lines.
