- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise, then duplicate the pattern in the lower half to the upper half.

2. To make the output, you have to...scale down the pattern to fit the upper left quadrant, then mirror it horizontally and vertically.

3. To make the output, you have to...invert the pattern, then duplicate it in all quadrants of the grid.

4. To make the output, you have to...move the pattern to the center of the grid, then duplicate it diagonally in all corners of the grid.

5. To make the output, you have to...imagine grid is cut in half vertical. Copy pattern to top and below left half. Mirror pattern to right half of grid to top and below.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...3x4 grid with one color pattern.
