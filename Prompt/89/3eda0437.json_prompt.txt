- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...inspect the chart, locate the white hexagons that will establish a balanced shape of either a hexagon or pentagon, and tint those hexagons purple.

2. To make the output, you have to...examine the grid, find the black squares that will allow for a symmetrical shape of either a square or rectangle, and color those squares pink.

3. To make the output, you have to...check the matrix, distinguish the brown cubes that will permit an equal shape of either a cube or rectangular prism, and dye those cubes blue.

4. To make the output, you have to...assess the graph, identify the blue circles that will form an asymmetrical shape of either a circle or oval, and shade those circles green.

5. To make the output, you have to...scan the table, spot the red triangles that will create an irregular shape of either a triangle or diamond, and fill those triangles yellow.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a grid with black, blue, and gray squares.
