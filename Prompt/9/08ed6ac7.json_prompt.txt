- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...alter the color of the tallest to gray, then second tallest to brown, third tallest to pink, then finally shortest to black for both pairs.

2. To make the output, you have to...leave the color of the tallest unchanged, switch the second tallest to gray, third tallest to brown, then finally shortest to blue for both pairs.

3. To make the output, you have to...change the color of the tallest to blue, then second talest to red,third tallest to green,then finally shortest to yellow for both pairs.

4. To make the output, you have to...change the color of the tallest to red, then second tallest to yellow, third tallest to blue, then finally shortest to green for both pairs.

5. To make the output, you have to...amend the color of the tallest to pink, then second tallest to green, third tallest to black, then finally shortest to cyan for both pairs.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...several different lengths of gray bars that rise vertically.
