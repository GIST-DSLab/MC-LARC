- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...rotate the image between two blue lines and adjacent pink pixels.

2. To make the output, you have to...delete the grid between two red lines and adjacent green pixels.

3. To make the output, you have to...make new grid between two gray lines and adjacent skyblue pixels. 

4. To make the output, you have to...alter the background between two white lines and adjacent yellow pixels. 

5. To make the output, you have to...create a circle between two purple lines and adjacent black pixels.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...scattered skyblue pixels and two gray parellel lines. each line is between skyblue pixels
