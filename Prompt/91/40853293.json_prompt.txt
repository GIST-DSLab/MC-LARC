- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...use only the horizontal colors to correspond with the similar ones.

2. To make the output, you have to...avoid overlapping colors and only use the horizontal color.

3. To make the output, you have to...disregard the vertical color and connect the similar colors.

4. To make the output, you have to...connect similar colors with that color. where they overlap you should use the vertical color

5. To make the output, you have to...layout all colors horizontally and match them with their opposites.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...pixels of different colors that are separated. And pixels of the same color are aligned vertically or horizontally.
