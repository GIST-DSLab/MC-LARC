- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...reduce the size of each subsequent outline, and place them overlapping each other.

2. To make the output, you have to...remove the background completely, so only the outlines remain.

3. To make the output, you have to...scatter the outlines randomly, with different sizes and shapes.

4. To make the output, you have to...place the outlines inside each other so the big one contain all others within it, leave the background the same color.

5. To make the output, you have to...fill the outlines with different colors, creating a sort of rainbow effect.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...various outlines of different size and color.
