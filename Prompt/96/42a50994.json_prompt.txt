- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...flip the input grid horizontally, identify which pixels are in a straight line, and change the color of all pixels to the foreground color or blue. Ended

2. To make the output, you have to...expand the input grid to twice its original size, mark out the pixels that are diagonally aligned, and change the color of every third pixel to green. Finalized 

3. To make the output, you have to...rotate the input grid by 180 degrees, locate disconnected pixels and change the colors of every other pixel to white. Completed 

4. To make the output, you have to...remove all the pixels from the input grid, isolate individual pixels, and fill the entire screen with a single color. Finished  

5. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid, identify which pixels are connected or touching any other and change background colors of single pixels to the background color or black. Done

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a grid with colored pixels scattered. Some of the pixels are touching other pixels {on sides/or corners} while some are singletons, not touching any pixels
