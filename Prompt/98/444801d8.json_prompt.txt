- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...fill the inside of the blue square border with a single colored pixel. Then, you also fill the pixels where the blue square border is open, and draw a single line on top of the border's upper edge.

2. To make the output, you have to...fill the entire square, except for the border, with alternating colored pixels in a checkerboard pattern, then add speckled shading to the border itself.

3. To make the output, you have to...negate the blue color of the border, replace it with a red hue, then fill in the enclosed space with a marble texture.

4. To make the output, you have to...push the blue square border off to one corner of the canvas, and then use the red and yellow pixels to color the remainder of the screen.

5. To make the output, you have to...create a fine line pattern inside the blue square border, then fill out the border edges with black and white pixels.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a pixel of a different color at the center of the blue rectangle with one pixel missing in the top middle.
