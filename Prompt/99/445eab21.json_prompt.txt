- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

2. To make the output, you have to...duplicated the biggest square pattern across the 2x2 grid.

3. To make the output, you have to...clear the entire 2x2 grid and start from scratch.

4. To make the output, you have to...use a mixture of colors from the smallest square pattern.

5. To make the output, you have to...remove all colors in the 2x2 grid.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.
