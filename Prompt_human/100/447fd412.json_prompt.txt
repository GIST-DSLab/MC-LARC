Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to, first and foremost, discard the input grid, then replicate the pattern based on the red part of the filled object. But each red pixel's location must remain stable, and if the size has expanded, then reduce the pattern's size accordingly.

2. To make the output, you have to..., firstly, copy the input grid, then copy the pattern based on the red part of the completed object. However, all the positions of the existing red pixels must remain fixed. Also, if the size has increased, increase the size of the pattern proportionally.

3. To make the output, you should start by duplicating the input grid, then ignore the red part while focusing on the completed object. Also, each red pixel's position must remain identical, and if the size has expanded, decrease the pattern's size proportionally.

4. To make the output, you ought to, first of all, copy the input grid, thereafter, copy the pattern without relying on the red aspect of the completed item. Although all of the red pixels' positions should remain the same, should there be an increase in size, do not adjust the pattern size proportionally.

5. To make the output, you have to..., firstly, copy the input grid, then erase the pattern based on the red part of the completed object. However, all the positions of the existing red pixels must remain fixed. Also, if the size has decreased, increase the size of the pattern proportionally.
