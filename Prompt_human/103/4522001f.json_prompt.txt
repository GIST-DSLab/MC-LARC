Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...chart a 7x7 grid on a flat plane. Look for the diagonal where the red square is located in the input. Use the green square in the same row and column to know where to place a 4x4 green square on the output grid. The position of the red square tells you where to place another 4x4 green square, connected at the center to the first square.

2. To make the output, you have to...draw a circle and divide it into 8 equal sections. Look at the red circle in the input diagram. The green circle in this section will indicate where on the output you should draw a 4x4 green square. The red circle's position tells you where to draw a second 4x4 green square connected on a side to your first square in the output circle.

3. To make the output, you have to...make grid 9x9. Note the diagonal that the red square is in in the input. The green square in the diagonal will indicate which corner in the output you should put a 4x4 green square in the output. The red square indicates which corner another 4x4 green square will touch it your new square in the output grid. So you will have two green 4x4 squares touching each other corner to corner.

4. To make the output, you have to...create a 3D cuboid with a 3x3 square base. Pay attention to the red square's position in the input. Its corresponding green square will indicate where to place a green 4x4 cube within the output cubiod. The red square indicates where another 4x4 green cube will touch your new square, but in the third dimension.

5. To make the output, you have to...start with a circular dart board divided into concentric circles. Use the distance of the red point from the center in the input to determine where to place a single 4x4 green square. The angle of the red point tells you where within your 4x4 green square another green square will touch it.
