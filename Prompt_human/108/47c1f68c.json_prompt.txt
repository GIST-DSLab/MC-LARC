Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...contemplate the refurbished matrix as the refurbished blueprint with the partition intact. replicate the figure from the tighter top right square of the input in a harmonizing shade to the fence from the input. Flip the image in one of the remaining pair of quadrants along the y and z dimension. ending with 3 figures in the original tone. you are done.

2. To make the output, you have to...view the reused mesh like the ancient grid with the separator retained. reproduce the object from the broader bottom left cell of the input in an opposing tint to the boundary from the input. Invert the form in the remaining two quadrants along the x and z axis.with a sum of 7 forms in a contrasting shade. you are done.

3. To make the output, you have to...think of the new grid like the old grid with the divider removed. recreate the shape from the smaller top left grid of the input in the same color as the divider from the input. Mirror the shape in each of the remaining three quadrants along the x and y axis. for a total of 4 shapes in the same color. you are done.

4. To make the output, you have to...consider the older framework as a simple pattern. apply the signature from the bottom right quadrant of the input in a color complementary to the divider from the input. Reflect the object in the opposing two quarters along the z and y axis. finalizing with five patterns in a diverse hue. you are done.

5. To make the output, you have to...perceive the refashioned lattice as the recurring grid with the barrier enforced. reestablish the design from the smaller bottom right sector of the input in a similar pigment to the barrier from the input. Rotate the sketch in both the remaining divisions along the x and y plane. terminating with 6 sketches in a varying pigmentation. you are done.
