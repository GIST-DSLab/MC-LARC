Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...replicate the plus sign three times in every direction without altering the color formation. This will result in a 9x9 square with mixed colors. 

2. To make the output, you have to...construct a circle using the color of the original plus sign. Paint over the circle with the center color, leaving only the edge in the original color.

3. To make the output, you have to...draw a 4x4 grid and fill the diagonal squares with the center color. All the other squares should be the color of the original plus sign. 

4. To make the output, you have to...create a 6x6 cross using the color of the original plus sign and fill the rest with the center color.

5. To make the output, you have to...extend the plus sign one square in every direction and then make a 5x5 'X' of the center color through the center square. You should result in nine squares the color of the center and eight the color of the original plus sign.
