Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...rotate the shape until it's parallel to the x-axis.

2. To make the output, you have to...mirror the shape at the corner of the x to the other corners of the x so that the x is surrounded by the corner shape.

3. To make the output, you have to...adjust the shape slightly towards the x-axis.

4. To make the output, you have to...inflate the shape until it fills the entire x.
