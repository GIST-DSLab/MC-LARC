Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... keep everything the same, but add blue squares around the red squares in order to create a row vertically and a row side to side that are overlapping and of the same range.

2. To make the output, you have to... remove the blue squares entirely and replace them at the corners, creating a large square of red squares in the middle. 

3. To make the output, you have to... remove all the shapes and then re-draw the blue squares, creating a cluster in the center with no overlap. 

4. To make the output, you have to... change all red squares to green circles and place them randomly, then surround each one with a blue square.

5. To make the output, you have to... transform the blue squares into triangles and scatter them around the edges, leaving the red squares as is.
