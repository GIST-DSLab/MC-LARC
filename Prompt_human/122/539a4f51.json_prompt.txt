Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...begin by filling the entire grid with the color black. Afterward, decide what pattern to create based on pure intuition.

2. To make the output, you have to...first, recognize for the input that any section in BLACK is just left-over grid space and is NOT part of the pattern.Start with the central square-shape and copy the pattern block-by-block. Keep extending the pattern, repeating it the entire grid is filled. For each section the same color as the central square-shape, the thickness is the same as the width of the square.Whatever color the central center-square is, same color patterns as the center-square should also have the same thickness as the width of the center-square (in boxes). (Example: 4x4 blue center-square = blue patterns should be 4 boxes wide)

3. To make the output, you have to...commence with the corner blocks and slowly work your way in. Colors should not repeat and there is no specific width for each section.

4. To make the output, you have to...start with whatever color you prefer. There's no need to follow the center-square, and the thickness of the patterns varies widely.

5. To make the output, you have to...first, ignore the input and start drawing randomly on the grid. Make sure not to repeat patterns and colors.
