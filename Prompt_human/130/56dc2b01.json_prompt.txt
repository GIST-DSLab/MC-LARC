Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...shift the red line to match the blue pattern, then insert a green line against the red one, perpendicular to the blue pattern.

2. To make the output, you have to...move the green pattern against the red line, then add a blue line against the green pattern parallel with the red line.

3. To make the output, you have to...rotate the green pattern to lie over the blue line, then subtract a red line from the green pattern, in line with the blue pattern.

4. To make the output, you have to...align the blue pattern to coincide with the green line, then embed a red line within the blue pattern, orthogonal to the green line.

5. To make the output, you have to...maneuver the red pattern to lie against the green line, then remove a blue line from the red pattern, parallel to the green line.
