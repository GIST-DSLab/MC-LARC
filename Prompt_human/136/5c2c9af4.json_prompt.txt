Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... start from the middle and continuously circle outward until you reach the edge. The radius of the circle should increase at the same pace throughout the process.

2. To make the output, you have to... use the two outer dots to form a square around the dot in the middle, then continue making squares surrounding the last square you created until you can not make any more (do not stop when you can not get an entire square inside the black background, even if you have enough room to make one line and the rest of the square would be outside of the black background then make that line). The amount of black space between each box should be the same width as the first square you created (so if the first box width of 2, make them all a width of 2)

3. To make the output, you have to... randomly place dots throughout the black background. Each dot should decrease in size as it gets farther from the center.

4. To make the output, you have to... create a series of triangles starting from the outer edges and working toward the center. The space between each triangle should be the same width as the first triangle you created.

5. To make the output, you have to... generate a series of ovals starting from the center and moving outward. The space between each oval should remain consistent based on the width of the initial oval.
