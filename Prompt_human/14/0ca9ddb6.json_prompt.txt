Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...draft the picture. Where there's a green triangle, position pink triangles at its vertices (3 total). Where there's a black rectangle, place teal rectangles to the left and right of it (2 total). Do nothing with white or magenta circles.

2. To make the output, you have to...copy image exactly. Where there's a red square, put yellow squares at it's corners (4 total). Where there's a dark blue square, put orange squares directly above and below it (4 total). Do nothing with light blue or magenta squares

3. To make the output, you have to...mimic the image. Where there's a yellow circle, place red circles around it (5 total). Where there's a light green rhombus, put purple triangles next to it (4 total). Ignore the beige and grey lines.

4. To make the output, you have to...replicate the illustration. Where there's a fuschia hexagon, place lime hexagons on its sides (6 total). Where there's a taupe circle, put brown circles on its corners (8 total). Do nothing with cyan or indigo stars.

5. To make the output, you have to...mirror the graphic. Where there's a blue circle, set green circles inside it (4 total). Where there's a bright yellow triangle, place dark red triangles around it (6 total). Leave alone the violet or turquoise hexagons.
