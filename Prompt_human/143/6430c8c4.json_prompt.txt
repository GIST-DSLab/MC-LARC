Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...merge the two sections side by side. Then you should examine each block. A block that has some of the pattern from the previous blocks is colored green. Any block that lacks pattern from any of the first blocks is colored black.

2. To make the output, you have to...put the two section over top of each other. Then you have to look at each block. A block that does not have any of the pattern from the old blocks is colored green. Any block that has pattern from either of the first blocks is colored black.

3. To make the output, you have to...stack the two section beneath each other. Then you must evaluate each block. A block that has none of the pattern from the primary blocks gets colored in green. Any block that showcases pattern from either of the latter blocks is colored white.

4. To make the output, you have to...put one section inside the other. Then, it's necessary to inspect each block. A block devoid of the pattern from the first set of blocks will be colored green. Each block that includes the pattern from any primary blocks is painted black.

5. To make the output, you have to...overlap the two sections diagonally. Then, you should scrutinize each block. A block containing some of the pattern from the initial blocks is rendered green. Any block that has no pattern from any of the secondary blocks is filled black.
