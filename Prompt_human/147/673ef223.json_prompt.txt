Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...replace the blue star with a purple one, and connect them to the pink curve using red stars. Duplicate the same pattern on the right, but rather than stopping where the purple stars WOULD be, proceed to the boundary of the rectangle.

2. To make the output, you have to...swap the blue dot for a green one and connect them to the orange line with purple dots. Extend the same model to the top, but halt at the green dots instead of progressing to the grid's edge.

3. To make the output, you have to...change the dot color from blue to yellow, and connect them to the red line using blue dots. Mirror the same design on the bottom but instead of stopping where the yellow dots WOULD be, continue to the edge of the grid.

4. To make the output, you have to...alter the circle color from green to orange, and bind them to the blue square using green circles. Imitate the same structure on the top, but instead of ceasing where the orange circles WOULD be, advance towards the corner of the pentagon.

5. To make the output, you have to...change the square color from red to pink and link it to the green triangle with yellow squares. Replicate the same layout on the left, but instead of finishing where the pink squares WOULD be, continue to the end of the circle.
