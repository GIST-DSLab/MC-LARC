Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...replicate the blueprint at each vertex. The pattern on the bottom is a mirror reflection of the top.

2. To make the output, you have to...modify the initial pattern across all corners. Then, invert the tops to reflect the bottoms. 

3. To make the output, you have to...duplicate the design at each edge. Let the pattern at the peak duplicate at the base. 

4. To make the output, you have to...copy-paste the pattern in each corner. The pattern on the bottoms flips parallel to the top.

5. To make the output, you have to...repeat the motif at every corner. Ensure the top patterns horizontally match the bottom ones.
