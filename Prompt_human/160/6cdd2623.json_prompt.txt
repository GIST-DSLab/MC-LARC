Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...draw two lines connecting both pairs of colored squares, all the way across the grid, same color as the squares (for instance, if you noticed that you have 4 green squares on the input, on the output connect the ones on top and bottom edge of the grid with a green line, and the ones on left and right edge of the grid with a green line). If both sets of squares are on the top/bottom or left/right, connect the lines across the grid, not along the edge (in other words, do not connect the two left squares or two top squares. Always connect the line to the opposite square). All other squares on your grid that are not your lines should be black.

2. To make the output, you have to...link all colored squares in a triangular pattern, regardless of their respective colors.

3. To make the output, you have to...change the color of all squares except for the ones connected by a line.

4. To make the output, you have to...connect each pair of colored squares using a line of a different color.

5. To make the output, you have to...draw one line connecting one pair of colored squares and leave the other pair disconnected.
