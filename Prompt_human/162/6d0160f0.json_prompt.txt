Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...pick the 3x3 area with a red square and relocate it to a 3x3 area in line with where the red square is among the 9 squares. Then change all squares except the 9 squares to black while making all blue squares within the 9 squares black. Don't alter the grid lines.

2. To make the output, you have to...take the 3x3 area with a blue square and slide that into a 3x3 area corresponding to the location of the green square within the 9 squares. Turn all squares within the 3x3 area white except for the blue square.

3. To make the output, you have to...swap the yellow square with a grey square within the 3x3 area, then turn all squares within the 9 squares green. Keep the lines of grey unchanged.

4. To make the output, you have to...take the 3x3 area with a yellow square and move it into a 3x3 area corresponding to where the yellow square is within the 9 squares. Then make all other squares within the other 9 squares black and any grey squares within the 9 squares black. The lines of grey stay.

5. To make the output, you have to...move all the squares in the 3x3 area into another random 3x3 area, then change their color to yellow. Leave remaining squares as they are.
