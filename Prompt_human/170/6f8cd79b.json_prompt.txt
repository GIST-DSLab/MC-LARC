Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...create a light blue border around the grid. So, any squares that are touching the edges are filled in with light blue. The rest of the squares inside the light blue border remain black.

2. To make the output, you have to...create a pattern within the grid using different colors. The edge color does not differ from the inner ones.

3. To make the output, you have to...create a red grid in the center, leaving a black border around the edges. The rest of the squares inside the red grid remain black.

4. To make the output, you have to...leave all squares black without creating any form of border. 

5. To make the output, you have to...fill all squares with black and then create a border in yellow. The space inside the yellow border remains black.
