Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...color pattern set of what order the colors were used in. Even if the line is thick, use color once at one line.

2. To make the output, you have to... use each color a specific number of times. The pattern or order of the colors does not matter.

3. To make the output, you have to... use only a select few colors from the set. Not all colors need to be used.

4. To make the output, you have to... randomize the order of the colors used. It does not matter if you end up using the same color twice in a row.

5. To make the output, you have to... neglect the thickness of the line. Use the same color for several lines if required.
