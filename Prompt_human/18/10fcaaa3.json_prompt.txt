Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... resize the input grid to be half of the width and height. Then, take the lower-right quadrant of your input grid and replicate it across all quadrants of the output grid. The number of colored squares in the output should be the same as in the input. Then, for each colored square in the output, add a light blue square above, below, left, and right of it. This should result in a cross-shaped pattern with the original colored square in the center.

2. To make the output, you have to... decrease the size of the input grid by one-third. Afterwards, replicate the upper-right quadrant of the original grid into your smaller output grid. There should be a reduction in colored squares in the output as compared to the input. Next, for each colored square in the output, add a light blue square above, below, and to either side, creating a square formation with the original colored square at the center.

3. To make the output, you have to... copy the input. Then, resize the output grid to be double the width and height. Then, copy the upper-left quadrant of your output grid (which is the same as the input grid) and paste it once in each quadrant of the output grid. You should have 4x as many colored squares in the output as in the input. Then, for each colored square in the output, do the following: add a light blue square 1 above and to the left, 1 above and to the right, 1 below and to the left, 1 below and to the right. Each light blue square should be diagonally touching the colored square, forming an X with the colored square in the center. Some of the X's might overlap or go off the screen. That is okay.

4. To make the output, you have to... keep the input grid the same size. Then, copy the entire input grid and paste it into each quadrant of the output grid. The total number of colored squares in the output should be 4 times the number in the input. Then, for each colored square in the output, add a light blue square in the four corners of it. This should result in a diamond-shaped pattern around each colored square.

5. To make the output, you have to... double the size of the input grid. Then, copy the central quadrant of your input grid, and paste it into each quadrant of the output grid. The number of colored squares in the output should be three times the number in the input. Then, for every colored square in the output, add a light blue square either to the left or to the right. The formation will form a straight line pattern.
