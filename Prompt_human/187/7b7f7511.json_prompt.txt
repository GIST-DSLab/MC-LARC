Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...add double the input, no matter the quantity.

2. To make the output, you have to...invert the input, essentially mirroring it.

3. To make the output, you have to...simply use the entire input, nothing needs to be removed.

4. To make the output, you have to...multiply the input by half, not entirely removing anything.

5. To make the output, you have to...get rid off one half of the input, may it be right, left or bottom half.
