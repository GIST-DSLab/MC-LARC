Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... divide the output grid into 4x4 squares and reproduce the input pattern in a clockwise spiral.

2. To make the output, you have to... replicate the input pattern four times across different corners of the 6x6 output grid without any rotation or shift.

3. To make the output, you have to... imagine the 6x6 output grid is split into four squares. Copy the input pattern onto the top left square, rotate 90 degrees to the right for the top right square, rotate again for the bottom right, then again for the bottom left.

4. To make the output, you have to... divide the 6x6 output grid into four squares, then scale down the input pattern and place it onto the top right and bottom left square.

5. To make the output, you have to... split the 8x8 output grid into four quadrants and reflect the input pattern across the vertical and horizontal axis.
