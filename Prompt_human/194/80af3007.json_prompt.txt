Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... remove the 9x9 pattern. Then, within each gray 3x3 square, reproduce the 9x9 pattern, so that each 3x3 gray square is a smaller version of the 9x9 pattern.

2. To make the output, you have to... reproduce the 9x9 pattern. Then, within each gray 3x3 square, reproduce the 9x9 pattern, so that each 3x3 gray square is a smaller version of the 9x9 pattern.

3. To make the output, you have to... reproduce the 9x9 pattern. Then, within each gray 3x3 square, invert the 9x9 pattern, so that each 3x3 gray square is a larger version of the 9x9 pattern.

4. To make the output, you have to... reproduce the 9x9 pattern. Then, within each blue 3x3 square, reproduce the 9x9 pattern, so that each 3x3 blue square is a smaller version of the 9x9 pattern.

5. To make the output, you have to... reproduce the 5x5 pattern. Then, within each gray 3x3 square, reproduce the 9x9 pattern, so that each 3x3 gray square is a smaller version of the 9x9 pattern.
