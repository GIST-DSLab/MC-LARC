Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...change the color of the grid to the color of the input grid not the lines. You need to adjust the number and positions of sections divided by lines of different colors horizontally and vertically according to the grid size.

2. To make the output, you have to...remove all colored lines and rearrange the grid number and positions without concern for color matching.

3. To make the output, you have to...adjust only the positions of sections divided by lines; color changes and grid sizes are irrelevant.

4. To make the output, you have to...maintain the original color of the grid with zero amendments and arrange colored lines according to the grid size.

5. To make the output, you have to...alter both the grid and line colors to match the input grid, disregarding the size and section adjustments.
