Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...manipulate the square to form an outline frame. Create a zigzag path that intersects the monochrome dots.

2. To make the output, you have to...transform the triangle into a pyramid shape. Construct a curvy line that meets the negative space.

3. To make the output, you have to...morph the ellipse to use as a contour guide. Formulate a straight line that overlaps the grayscale pixel.

4. To make the output, you have to...adjust the circle into a hexagonal boundary. Subsequently, draw the diagonal line crossing at the points of intersection.

5. To make the output, you have to...replicate the rectangle to be a background grid. Then make the vertical and horizontal line that crosses at the color pixel.
