Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... rotate a standalone 5x5 grid, different in configuration than the rest 5x5 grid patterns, around the center of the output grid.

2. To make the output, you have to... copy a single 1x1 grid, which is identical in shape to the other 1x1 grid patterns, in the center of the output grid.

3. To make the output, you have to... move a whole 3x3 grid, which is distinct in arrangement from other 3x3 grid patterns, to the edges on the output grid.

4. To make the output, you have to... replicate a single 2x2 grid, which is different in shape from the other 2x2 grid patterns, at each of the four corners onto the output grid.

5. To make the output, you have to... transpose an individual 4x4 grid, which is similar in structure to other 4x4 grid patterns, at random positions on the output grid.
