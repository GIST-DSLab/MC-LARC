Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...move each pattern so that the gray square in each pattern occupies the center square of the output 3x3 grid.

2. To make the output, you have to...rotate each pattern such that the white square in each pattern occupies the corner squares of the output 3x3 grid.

3. To make the output, you have to...shift each pattern so that the blue square in each pattern sits on the last square of the output 3x3 grid.

4. To make the output, you have to...resize each pattern so that the red square in each pattern fills the entire output 3x3 grid.

5. To make the output, you have to...flip each pattern so that the black square in each pattern occupies the top row of the output 3x3 grid.
