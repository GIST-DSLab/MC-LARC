Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...leave the input grid intact on the periphery of your output grid. then clone the patterns without inverting them. 

2. To make the output, you have to...remove the input grid from your output grid. then overlay the patterns without flipping them. 

3. To make the output, you have to...put the input grid in the center of your output grid. then create repeat the patterns but flip them.

4. To make the output, you have to...replace the input grid with a different model. then alter the patterns instead of repeating them. 

5. To make the output, you have to...ignore the input grid for your output grid. then disrupt the patterns instead of duplicating them.
