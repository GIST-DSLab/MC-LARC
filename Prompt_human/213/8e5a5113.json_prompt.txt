Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... ignore the first square and work only with the black squares, rotating the color pattern 270 degrees to the right.

2. To make the output, you have to... recreate the first square with inverted colors, then in the next black square skew the pattern diagonally, and finally, in the last square flip the pattern horizontally.

3. To make the output, you have to...copy the first square exactly. Then in the next black square rotate the color pattern 90 degrees to the right. Then in the final black square rotate the pattern another 90 degrees.

4. To make the output, you have to... reflect the first square over the vertical axis, then in the next black square rotate the color pattern 180 degrees, and finally, in the last black square mirror the pattern vertically. 

5. To make the output, you have to...copy the first square exactly, then in the next black square shift the color pattern to the left, and finally, in the last black square invert the colors.
