Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...alter the shape's size to the grid's size and maintain the original colors.

2. To make the output, you have to...reset the grid's settings and the two colors are different from the shape.

3. To make the output, you have to...ensure the shape is smaller than the grid and mix up the two colors.

4. To make the output, you have to...make the grid the same size as the shape and the two colors are just like in the shape.

5. To make the output, you have to...downsize the grid to match the shape, but the colors don't need to be the same.
