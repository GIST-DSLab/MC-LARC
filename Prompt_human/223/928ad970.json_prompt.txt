Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... interpret the input grid. Then, without using the color of the colored rectangle, make the circular shape possible that will fit within the four grey dots. The outside of the new shape should not touch the inside of all four grey dots.

2. To make the output, you have to... discard the input grid. Then, excluding the color of the colored rectangle, make the thinnest rectangle possible that will not fit inside the four grey dots. The outside of the new rectangle should overlap the outside of all four grey dots.

3. To make the output, you have to... edit the input grid. Then, using the color of the colored rectangle, make the average rectangle possible that will be located outside the four grey dots. The outside of the new rectangle should touch the outside of all four grey dots.

4. To make the output, you have to... copy the input grid. Then, using the color of the colored rectangle, make the largest rectangle possible that will fit inside the four grey dots. The outside of the new rectangle should touch the inside of all four grey dots.

5. To make the output, you have to... ignore the input grid. Then, using the color of the colored rectangle, make the smallest rectangle possible that will fit inside the four grey dots. The outside of the new rectangle should avoid touching the inside of all four grey dots.
