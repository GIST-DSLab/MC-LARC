Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...compare the squares in the top and bottom 4x4 square. If they match (both black or both color) make the output square black. If they do not match, make the output square green.

2. To make the output, you have to...combine the elements in the right and left 3x3 square. If they are similar (either white or color), make the output square blue. If not, make the output square orange.

3. To make the output, you have to... analyze the circles in the first and last 5x5 square. If they are the same (both black or both color), make the output circle purple. If they differ, make the output circle yellow.

4. To make the output, you have to... blend the rectangles in the front and the rear 7x7 squares. If they align (both black or color), make the output rectangle brown. If they are unmatched, make the output rectangle silver.

5. To make the output, you have to... merge the hexagons in the north and south 6x6 squares. If they coincide (either black or color), make the output hexagon red. If they disagree, make the output hexagon pink.
