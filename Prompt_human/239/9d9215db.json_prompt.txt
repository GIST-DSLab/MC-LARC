Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... take the main color and create a border frame from the location it is in. take the color next to it and put it on the end point of the border frame. take the color box that is further away and copy that into the 4 directions making sure they are mirror images. A black box should be between each color box.

2. To make the output, you have to... choose the unimportant color and erase the border from its place. Add the first color to the middle of the border frame. Grab the nearest color box and place those in the four corners, disregarding image mirror. An empty space should exist between each color box.

3. To make the output, you have to... select the secondary color and delete the border frame from the position it is located. Implement the color on the opposite end of the border frame. Capture the color box that is nearer and scatter it in random directions without having a similar reflection. A white square has to be between each color box.

4. To make the output, you have to... choose the main color but avoid creating any border frame. Take the color after it and put it in the beginning point. Pick the color box that is closer and replicate that up and down ignoring any mirror pattern. Insert a red circle in between each color box.

5. To make the output, you have to... avoid any color and start designing a border frame on the corner. Take the previous color and put it in the center of the border frame. Use the furthest color box and distribute that to 4 corners without ensuring symmetry. A green diamond should be between each color box.
