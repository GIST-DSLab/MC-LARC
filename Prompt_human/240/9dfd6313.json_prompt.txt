Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...rotate the pattern 180 degrees to the left and keep it as it is. The output should be a rotated version of the input.

2. To make the output, you have to...shrink the pattern to half of its original size and fill the empty space. The output should be a condensed version of the input.

3. To make the output, you have to...stretch the pattern to twice its original size and keep it as it is. The output should be an enlarged version of the input.

4. To make the output, you have to...rotate the pattern 90 degrees to the right and then flip it over to it's reverse. the output should be an 90 degrees mirror image of the input.

5. To make the output, you have to...invert the pattern's colors and then rotate it 45 degrees. The output should be an inverted and slightly rotated image of the input.
