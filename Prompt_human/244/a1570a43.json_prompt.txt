Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... treat the 4 pixels like a racing track. Drive the random shape around the track until it reaches the finish line.

2. To make the output, you have to... think of the 4 pixels as a picture frame. Reposition the random shape to be centered in that frame.

3. To make the output, you have to... imagine the 4 pixels as a game board. Rotate the random shape to fit perfectly on the board.

4. To make the output, you have to... consider the 4 pixels as a volume button. Amplify the size of the random shape to match that button.

5. To make the output, you have to... view the 4 pixels as a computer keyboard. Rescale the dimensions of the random shape to match the keyboard keys.
