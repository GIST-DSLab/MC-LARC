Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...move the existing pattern to a different section. The area next to the pattern should remain blank.

2. To make the output, you have to...design a completely new pattern in the empty section. The two patterns should be entirely different.

3. To make the output, you have to...alter the original pattern in small ways for the new section. The two patterns should be slightly different.

4. To make the output, you have to...erase the existing pattern and leave the section empty. There should be a clear space next to the pattern.

5. To make the output, you have to...copy the pattern exactly to the new empty section. There should be two of the same pattern side-by-side.
