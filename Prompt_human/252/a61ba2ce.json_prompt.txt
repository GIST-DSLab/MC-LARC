Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...follow the colored pattern and put them on all the corners exactly how the pattern is placed. Then fill in the middle 4 squares with black.

2. To make the output, you have to...use the grayscale pattern and put them in random positions. Then fill in the middle 4 squares with white.

3. To make the output, you have to...follow an inverted version of the colored pattern, placing it on the sides. Then color the middle square with black.

4. To make the output, you have to...ignore the colored pattern and put them on all the corners however you like. Then leave the middle 4 squares empty.

5. To make the output, you have to...scatter the colors without any pattern, placing them in the center. Then color the 4 corner squares with black.
