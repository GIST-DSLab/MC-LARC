Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...detach the red, green, and blue bars from each other. The green bar should decrease in length by one square each time it moves up, while the blue bar should increase in length each time it moves away from the red bar.

2. To make the output, you have to...copy your red input boxes to the output grid. And then, you need to add green bars above the red bar and blue bars below it, all attached to the left side. Furthermore, the green bar should increase in length by one square each time it moves up from the red bar, while the blue bar should decrease in length by one square each time it moves away from the red bar. The green bar continues this process all the way up to the top of the grid, while the blue bar repeats until it becomes one square in length.

3. To make the output, you have to...swap the positions of the red and green bars while keeping the blue bar consistent. The length of the bars should remain the same throughout the process.

4. To make the output, you have to...align the red, green, and blue bars at the top of the grid. The green and blue bars should remain the same length while the red bar incrementally decreases in length.

5. To make the output, you have to...move the red input boxes to the right side of the grid. The green bar should remain the same length across the grid, while the blue bar should change in length randomly each time it moves away from the red bar.
