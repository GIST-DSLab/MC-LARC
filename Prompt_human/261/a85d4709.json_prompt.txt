Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...check the position of the grey pixels. Where the grey pixel is in the first column, the corresponding pixels in that raw in the output should have color red. If the pixel is in the middle column, the corresponding pixels in the output should be yellow. Where the grey pixel is in the the last column , the corresponding pixel in that raw in the output should be green.

2. To make the output, you have to...check the image's grayscale intensity. Light gray results in red pixels, medium gray corresponds to yellow pixels, and dark gray gives you green pixels in the resulting image.

3. To make the output, you have to...measure the size of each grey pixel and arrange accordingly. Small pixels should be displayed as red, medium-sized pixels as yellow, and large pixels as green in the output image.

4. To make the output, you have to...create a new layer for each color. Assign red to the bottom layer, yellow to the middle layer, and green to the top layer. The grey pixel column does not affect the output color.

5. To make the output, you have to...change the grey pixels according to their sequences. The first pixel should be red, the second pixel should be yellow, and the third pixel should be green, regardless of their location on the grid.
