Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...color the pixels around the colored pixel by following the compass directions, so it's red for North, blue for East, yellow for South and green for West. Paint the colored pixel in the input white.

2. To make the output, you have to...make the pixels touching the colored pixel at its corners colored in green for the top left corner pixel, pink for the pixel touching its top right corner, light blue for the pixel touching its bottom left corner and orange for the pixel touching its bottom right corner. the colored pixel in the input should be colored black

3. To make the output, you have to...make the pixels touching the colored pixel along edges colored in gold for the top edge, silver for the right edge, bronze for the bottom edge and copper for the left edge, leaving the colored pixel in the input as blue.

4. To make the output, you have to...apply colors to the pixels adjoining the colored pixel based upon their relative position so that the pixel on the upper side is crimson, on the right side is violet, on the lower is navy and on the left is peach. The colored pixel in the input remains gray.

5. To make the output, you have to...paint the pixels adjacent to the colored pixel at its corners yellow for the top left pixel, purple for the top right pixel, dark blue for the bottom left pixel and white for the bottom right pixel. Keep the colored pixel in the input red.
