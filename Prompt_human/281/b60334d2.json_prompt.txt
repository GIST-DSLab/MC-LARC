Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...place the grey block in such a manner that it lays flat in between the east and west position. The north and south position holds the blue blocks while the grey block retains its color.

2. To make the output, you have to...use the grey block as the center of a square that is surrounded by alternating grey and blue blocks. Blue is at the north, east, south and west position. Change the grey center to black.

3. To make the output, you have to...set the grey block not as the center, but to the side of a square that is surrounded by blue and green blocks only. The center position is blank.

4. To make the output, you have to...rotate the blocks in such a way that the grey blocks align along the corners and blue blocks at the center. The grey blocks are now converted to red.

5. To make the output, you have to...organize the blocks in a circular fashion with the blue blocks enclosing the grey block. Change the blue blocks surrounding the grey center to green.
