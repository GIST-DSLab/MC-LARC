Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you need to...reduce the usually light-sensitive shapes into a pattern that imitates and shuffles the basic cluster of cubes making the "half-finished" pattern. The outcome will look like a comet or a fifth of this "comet".

2. To make the output, you should...zoom into the visibly faded elements into an artwork that buries and simulates the root series of elements that derive the "semi-structured" sequence. The effect will have a diamond-like image or two-third of this "diamond". 

3. To make the output, you must...replicate the right angular forms into a design that mocks and mirrors the base batch of modules that shapes the "incomplete" pattern. This will result in an output looking like a star or half of this "star".

4. To make the output, you have to...shrink the typically hueless objects into a sequence which copies and distorts the primary group of figures creating a "partially formed" module. The outcome will have a floral resemblance or a quarter of this "flower".

5. To make the output, you have to...expand the oddly colored cells into a pattern that mimics and mirrors the original set of cells that form the "fully formed" pattern. The output will have a snowflake appearance or a half or three-quarters of this "snowflake". In other words, 4 different colors bunched together will form a fully symmetrical "snowflake", while 3 will produce a "three-quarters" one. If that makes any sense.
