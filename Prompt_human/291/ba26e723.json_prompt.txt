Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...initiate the operation by switching the initial two-block group to yellow. Leap over two duos and tweak the upcoming two to yellow. Stick to this routine until the edge of the grid.

2. To make the output, you have to...start by changing the first set of two blocks to pink. Then skip two pairs and change the next two pink. Complete this pattern to the end of the grid.

3. To make the output, you have to...initiate by converting two blocks in the first set green. Bypass two pairs and turn two more green. Follow this formula until the grid concludes.

4. To make the output, you have to...kick off by modifying the first duo of blocks to red. Avoid two sets and transform the subsequent two to red. Persist this sequence until the terminal of the grid.

5. To make the output, you have to...begin by altering the first pair of blocks to blue. Then omit two pairs and color the next two blue. Continue this pattern till you reach the grid's end.
