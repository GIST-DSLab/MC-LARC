Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... maintain the color of the intersection, keeping it the same as the input grid. 

2. To make the output, you have to... remove the intersection of the two lines completely. 

3. To make the output, you have to... swap the colors of the intersecting lines with each other.

4. To make the output, you have to... copy the input grid. In the output, change the color where the two lines meet so that the other color line is on top.

5. To make the output, you have to... switch the colors of the entire grid randomly.
