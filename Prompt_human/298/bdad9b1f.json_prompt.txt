3. To make the output, you have to... draw a line from the centre to the right edge for the red squares and from the top to the bottom for the blue squares, keeping the overlapping section black.

4. To make the output, you have to... count the blue squares diagonally and the red squares vertically, leaving the square where they intersect as white.
