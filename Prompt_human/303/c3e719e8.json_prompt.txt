Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...ignore the color composition of the input box and randomly decide on colors for the new grid. The grid patterns can be copied from anywhere in the input and placed anywhere in the new grid. All the black boxes should be located on the outer edges of the new grid.

2. To make the output, you have to...start by identifying the least common color in the input grid and copying all the 3x3 boxes into the new grid. If the top left box is red, then copy the entire 3x3 box into the top right corner of the new grid. The black holes should ideally cover up more than half of the new grid's area.

3. To make the output, you have to...find random colors in the old grid and copy them into the new grid. If there is a blue box in the old grid, you copy it into the top left corner of the new grid. Colors that appear less in the old grid will be painted black in the new grid.

4. To make the output, you have to...create nine 3x1 patterns in the new grid and fill them out without considering any specific pattern. The color that is most common in the input grid won't have to be remembered. The colors that occur less in the input grid should reflect in the new grid in form of scattered black boxes.

5. To make the output, you have to...notice that you can copy the original 3x3 grid 9 times into the new grid (nine 3x3 patterns) and fill out the new grid in this pattern. Now look at which color is the most common in the input grid and keep that in mind. For example, if blue is the most common color in the input box and the top, left box is blue then copy the entire 3x3 box into the top, left 3x3 area in the new grid. If the bottom, middle box is blue then copy the entire 3x3 grid into the middle top of the new grid. Alternatively, suppose the top right box is red (or any other color that is not the most common) in the input grid...then that top right 3x3 area should be black in the new grid. Keep following that pattern until you're done. The black holes should now correlate to the locations of the colors of the boxes (in the input grid) that were not the most common.
