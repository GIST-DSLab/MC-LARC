Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...delete the entire grid, then sketch a freehand drawing. Final image should be abstract art.

2. To make the output, you have to...invert the colors of the grid and leave it empty. Concluding task involves the grid remaining untouched.

3. To make the output, you have to...crop the grid into small pieces and randomly rearrange. The outcome must result in a mosaic.

4. To make the output, you have to...duplicate the entire grid, then fill in the solid color to exactly match the checker pattern. Finally result should be entirely checker patterned.

5. To make the output, you have to...paint patches of different colors on the grid. By the end, the product should represent a field of flowers.
