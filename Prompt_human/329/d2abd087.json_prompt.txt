Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...erase all the squares from the input grid, and then redraw the entire grid from scratch.

2. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid. Then count how many gray squares make up each of the individual shapes. If the shape uses (6) gray squares, change those gray squares to red. If the shape has any other number of gray squares, change the gray squares to blue.

3. To make the output, you have to...leave the gray squares as they are, and instead focus on changing the white squares to blue or red.

4. To make the output, you have to...rotate the input grid counterclockwise by 90 degrees, then replace all the gray squares with black squares.

5. To make the output, you have to...identify the shapes made from green squares. If the shape uses (6) green squares, turn it yellow. If it uses a different number of green squares, turn it purple.
