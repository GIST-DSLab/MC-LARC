Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...Constrict the pattern in the direction opposite to where the red square is located. If less than one corner has a red square, constrict all corners inversely. Pattern should go down three and left two by a width of four.

2. To make the output, you have to...Maintain the pattern in the position that the green circle is found. If more than two corners have a yellow triangle, keep those corners. Pattern should go left two and up one by half the width.

3. To make the output, you have to...Extend the pattern in the direction that the red square is located on the square. If more than one corner has a red square, extend all corners to the edge by the width of the square. Pattern should go up one and over one by a width of two.

4. To make the output, you have to...Expand the pattern in the direction that the blue square is placed. If only one corner has a red square, expand that corner only. Patterns should go down two and right one with a margin of one. 

5. To make the output, you have to...Compress the pattern towards the center where the red square is not located. If a corner doesn't have a red square, compress all corners equivalently. Pattern should shift down and left uniformly.
