Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... make one similiarly colored squar inside the light blue figure for each colored square around the exterior. Place the colored squares along the most outer edge of the blue figure, closest to their corresponding block.

2. To make the output, you have to... form one differently colored circle inside the green figure for each colored triangle on the interior. Arrange the colored circles along the middle layer of the green figure, furthest from their corresponding block.

3. To make the output, you have to... assemble a single same-colored diamond within the red figure for each color-coordinated ball within the interior. Set the colored diamonds along the inner edge of the red figure, furthest from their matching block.

4. To make the output, you have to... generate one correspondingly colored line within the purple figure for every colored symbol outside the frame. Situate the colored lines along the central area of the purple figure, nearest to their associated block.

5. To make the output, you have to... construct one similiarly shaded hexagon inside the yellow figure for every colored rectangle along the exterior. Position the shaded hexagons at the innermost section of the yellow figure, closest to their relevant block.
