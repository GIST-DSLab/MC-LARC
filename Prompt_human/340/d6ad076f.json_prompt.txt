Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...rotate the input grid by 90 degrees and maintain the shapes as they are. The size isn't important.

2. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid and connect the two shapes with the blue grid.it must be smaller than the size of the small input shape.

3. To make the output, you have to...overlay the input grid with a green one, the size of the input shapes isn't relevant.

4. To make the output, you have to...split the input grid into two equal parts and color them with different colors. Ignore the size factor.

5. To make the output, you have to...remove the input grid and replace it with a red one. The size of the grid shouldn't be considered.
