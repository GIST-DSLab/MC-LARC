Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...find all instances of blue and red pixels, and swap their places.

2. To make the output, you have to...rearrange the pixels in a random pattern, altering colours is not necessary.

3. To make the output, you have to...replace the entire image with a green filter overlay.

4. To make the output, you have to...merge any adjacent green and red pixels into yellow ones, disregarding their position.

5. To make the output, you have to...copy the exact entire image. Where ever a green and red pixel touch on their sides (not diagonal/corners), replace the green pixel with light blue, and replace the red pixel with black. (remove it)
