Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...continue the lines to all edges, using alternating the color pattern.

2. To make the output, you have to...erase all the lines and restart with a different color range.

3. To make the output, you have to...use a single solid color to fill the space, ignoring the edges.

4. To make the output, you have to...subtract the lines from all edges, using the same color scheme.

5. To make the output, you have to...cut out the lines from the middle, not worrying about following a color pattern.
