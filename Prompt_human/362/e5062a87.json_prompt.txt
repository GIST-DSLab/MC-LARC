Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...detect similar patterns between pink triangles and orange diamonds, and turn all the orange diamonds into pink.

2. To make the output, you have to...detect any green circle clones of the red square patterns and modify the green circles to squares.

3. To make the output, you have to...find any black squares that are in the same pattern as the red squares, then change the black squares in each pattern to red.

4. To make the output, you have to...find any red circles that are in the same pattern as the square ones, then transform the circles to triangles.

5. To make the output, you have to...exchange the blue rectangles for yellow diamonds, if they fit the same design as the blue ones.
