Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... use the colors of the patterned grid, but change the size and shape, then place it on the other grid not following the orientation of the original pattern.

2. To make the output, you have to... randomize all of the colors of the pattern, while maintaining the size and orientation, then place it randomly on the blank grid, disregarding the original grid layout.

3. To make the output, you have to... copy the original pattern, but instead of placing it diagonally, place it horizontally across the blank grid, altering the sizes and colors as you go along.

4. To make the output, you have to...without any change in the colors of any patterns, shapes, size and the background, copy the pattern on the black colored grids, to the other grid which is not patterned thus replicating it with the pattern and size of the black grid, continue to add the same pattern diagonally towards the only edge of the grid.

5. To make the output, you have to... take only the green color from the pattern, and create a new pattern on the blank grid, disregarding the original pattern's size, shape and orientation.
