Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... create the grid. Then copy the original pattern onto the output grid. Next, create a mirror pattern from the original pattern underneath the original pattern. Then copy the whole original and mirror pattern to fill in the rest of the black grid.

2. To make the output, you have to... erase the entire grid. After that, reconstruct the original pattern in a random location on the new grid. Ignore the mirror pattern since it's not necessary. Finally, fill the rest of the grid with any random patterns.

3. To make the output, you have to... shatter the grid into pieces. Later, redefine the original pattern into something completely different. Work on a new design instead of mirroring the original. Complete the grid by scattering various patterns in a mosaic approach.

4. To make the output, you have to... sculpt the grid. Then redraw the original pattern on top of the already existing pattern. Next, create a polar opposite from the original pattern instead of a mirror. Fill the rest of the grid with the crafted inverse pattern.

5. To make the output, you have to... demolish the grid. Following destruction, discard the original pattern. Instead of mirroring the original pattern, create a brand new concept. Then fill the open spaces in the grid with the newly designed pattern, not using the original one at all.
