Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...duplicate the original grid. Draw perpendicular lines from the pixels of x color to touch the nearest pixels of y color. The touch point should be the x color. If the pixel of x color is between 2 pixels of y color, draw one line of x color through the pixel of x color, connecting the pixels of y color. Encircle each pixel of x color (touch point) on the pixel of y color with a square of y color. It should be a square of y color with the center of x color on the pixel of y color. Ready.

2. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid. Make perpendicular lines from the dots of y color to touch the closest lines of x color. The point of touch should be the y color. If the dot of y color is between 2 lines of y color you should make one lines of y color going through the dot of y color and connecting the lines of x colors. Surround each dot of y color (point of touch) on the line of x color with a square of x color. It should be a square of x color with the center of y color on the line of x color. Done.

3. To make the output, you have to...replicate the initial grid. Establish diagonal lines from the spots of x color to reach the closest spots of y color. The point of contact should be of x color. If the spot of x color is amid 2 spots of y color, form a line of x color crossing the spot of x color, linking the spots of y color. Cover every spot of x color (contact point) on the spot of y color with a square of y color. It should be a square of y color situated over the spot of x color on the spot of y color. Finished.

4. To make the output, you have to...piece together a copy of the input grid. Arrange straight lines from the points of y color to meet with the nearest points of x color. The meeting point should be of y color. In case the point of y color is sandwiched between two points of y color, sketch a line of y color passing through the point of y color and joining the points of x color. Encompass each point of y color (intersection point) on the point of x color with a square of x color. It ought to be a square of x color with the center of y color on the point of x color. Complete.

5. To make the output, you have to...build the output by mimicking the source grid. Craft vertical lines from the nodes of y color to touch upon the immediate nodes of x color. The point of junction should mirror the color of y. If a node of y is in between two y nodes, a y-colored line should be drawn piercing the y node and connecting the x nodes. Circle the y node (confluence point) on the x node with a squared representation in the x color. This should depict a square of the x color with the epicenter being the y color situated on the x node line. Concluded.
