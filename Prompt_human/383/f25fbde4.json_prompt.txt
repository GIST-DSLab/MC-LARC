Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...double pattern and fit the resulting pattern to scale. If it's 1x5 the result should be 2x10.

2. To make the output, you have to...leave the pattern as it is and fit the resulting pattern to scale. If it's 1x5 the result should remain 1x5.

3. To make the output, you have to...increase the pattern by a factor of three and fit the resulting pattern to scale. If it's 1x5 the result should be 3x15.

4. To make the output, you have to...decrease the pattern by a factor of four and fit the resulting pattern to scale. If it's 1x5 the result should be 0.25x1.25.

5. To make the output, you have to...halve the pattern and fit the resulting pattern to scale. If it's 1x5 the result should be 0.5x2.5.
