Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...remove the colored grids from the input, leaving a blank grid. There should be no color A or color B grids left.

2. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid, identify the colors of the colored grids. we will call it color A and color B. Around the grids with color A, create a 3x3 square with color B, surrounding the color A grids. Around the grids with color B, create a 3x3 square with color A, surrounding the color B grids. Now we should have four 3x3 squares, in which two squares are A color with B colored grid in their centers.

3. To make the output, you have to...identify the colors of the colored grids, we will call them color A and color B. Around the grids with color A, create a 3x3 square with color A, surrounding the color B grids. Around the grids with color B, create a 3x3 square with color B, surrounding the color A grids. Now we should have two 3x3 squares, each with the same color as their centers.

4. To make the output, you have to...keep the input grid as it is, without creating any new squares or changing colors. The output grid would be an exact copy of the input grid.

5. To make the output, you have to...exchange the colors of the input grid, switching color A with color B and vice versa. There should be no colored squares around the original grids.
