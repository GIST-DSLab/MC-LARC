Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...rotate the grey pattern 90 degrees and ensure it rests on top of the red one. The resulting output will have the orange pattern inside the grey one.

2. To make the output, you have to...flip the red pattern over the orange one in a similar way to a mirror image. The resulting output should now have the orange pattern inside red one.

3. To make the output, you have to...invert the orange pattern and place it within the grey one. The resulting output should have the orange pattern surrounded by the grey one.

4. To make the output, you have to...flip the grey pattern over the red one like an mirror image. The resulting output should now have the grey pattern outside of the orange one.

5. To make the output, you have to...keep the grey pattern parallel to the red one. The resulting output should have the grey pattern next to the orange one.
