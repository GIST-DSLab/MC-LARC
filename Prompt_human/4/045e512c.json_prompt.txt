Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... invert the color palette of the remaining cubes, clustering them at the center of the grid without any resemblance to the reference shape.

2. To make the output, you have to... randomize the color arrangement of the grid and purposely avoid replicating any recognizable shape or pattern seen before.

3. To make the output, you have to... construct a completely new shape in the grid using opposing colors, disregarding any pre-existing pattern or start point.

4. To make the output, you have to... erase the reference shape, using the color of the other blocks as a guide, before expanding to the edge of the grid with an unrelated pattern.

5. To make the output, you have to... replicate the reference shape, using the color of the other blocks as a start point and then replicate that pattern to the edge of the grid, even if it needs a incomplete shape.
