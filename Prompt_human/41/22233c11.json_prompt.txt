Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... Paint each pair of tiles adjacent to the green tiles with bright red, skipping two black tiles in the process. Imagine an H is trying to be formed.

2. To make the output, you have to... Place a yellow tile in each corner and an orange tile in the center. Stay clear of any black and green tiles.

3. To make the output, you have to... Put a light blue tile diagonal of each side of the green tiles that skips one black tile. Imagine an X is trying to be created, EXCEPT the light blue tiles skip the first diagonal tile (leave black) to make one light blue tile on each side.

4. To make the output, you have to... Create a Z pattern using a blend of pink tiles and blue tiles, steering clear from any green tiles.

5. To make the output, you have to... Overlay the black tiles with purple tiles to form an inverted Y, excluding any close proximity with the green tiles.
