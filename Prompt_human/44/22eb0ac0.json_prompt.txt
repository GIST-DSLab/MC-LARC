Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to....ignore the color of the blocks entirely and fill in the horizontal row with a random color.

2. To make the output, you have to....flip the input vertically. If two blocks on the same vertical line are the same color, fill in the rest of that line with that color. Disregard the blocks on the same line that are different colors.

3. To make the output, you have to....copy the input. If two blocks across from each other are the same color, fill in the rest of that horizontal row with that color. Don't do anything with the blocks across from each other that are different colors

4. To make the output, you have to....erase every line that has two blocks with different colors. If two blocks across from each other are the same color, do not change anything with that horizontal row.

5. To make the output, you have to....alternate the colors in each row. If two blocks across from each other are the same color, change the rest of the row to a different color. If the blocks across from each other are different colors, leave it as is.
