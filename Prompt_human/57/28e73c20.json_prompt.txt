Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...commence at the center and move outwards in a spiral. Once you hit blue, halt at three blocks distance and maintain the pattern. Conclude on the outer edge. 

2. To make the output, you have to...begin in the lower left and go upwards. Touch the top edge and shift right. Carry on in an anti-clockwise direction. Upon hitting red, terminate one block away and keep to the pattern. End at the top right corner. 

3. To make the output, you have to...initiate at the middle right and advance left. Reach the corner and ascend. Follow a zigzag route. When you come across purple, pause four blocks afar and adhere to the pattern. Wrap up at the periphery.

4. To make the output, you have to...start from the bottom right and go left. Touch the corner and move up. Proceed in a counter-clockwise manner. When you reach yellow, stop two blocks away and resume the pattern. Finish at the corner. 

5. To make the output, you have to...create a green pattern. Start in the upper left and go right. Hit the corner and go down. Continue in clockwise order. When you hit green, stop one blocks away and continue in the pattern. End in the center.
