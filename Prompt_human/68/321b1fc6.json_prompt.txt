Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... add more solid colored patterns, while maintaining the original multi-colored pattern and replacing its color with green tiles.

2. To make the output, you have to... keep the solid colored patterns but alter each pattern's colors. After that, you should also add some white tiles in the multi-colored pattern.

3. To make the output, you have to... take away the solid colored patterns and substitute them with grayscale variations, then modify the original multi-colored pattern with blue tiles.

4. To make the output, you have to... replace the solid colored patterns with the multi-colored versions, so each pattern has the same coloring. Then remove the original multi-colored pattern by replacing it entirely with black tiles.

5. To make the output, you have to... include an additional four-color pattern to complement the solid colored patterns and then swap them out randomly.
