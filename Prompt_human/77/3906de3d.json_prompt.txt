Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...reverse the colors, making all red blue and blue red.

2. To make the output, you have to...imagine the blue is a vacuum and sucks the red up into the open spaces. Move all red straight up.

3. To make the output, you have to...rotate the red 90 degrees clockwise around the blue.

4. To make the output, you have to...push all blue out of the way and fill the gaps with red.
