Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...use triangles in between the rectangle shapes, not squares.

2. To make the output, you have to...alternate black and colored squares, but place them around the edges of the rectangle rather than in the middle.

3. To make the output, you have to...place colored squares randomly across the rectangle without any particular order.

4. To make the output, you have to...put black squares in the middle of the rectangle shapes so that the pattern is colored square, black square, colored square, black square and so on in the middle of each rectangle.

5. To make the output, you have to...fill the rectangle entirely with black squares, with no space for colored squares.
