Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...copy the gray itself. Imagine the non-gray boxes are attracted to the gray columns/row like magnets. so change the non-gray boxes to gray and remove the difference between so that each now gray box is touching the central row.

2. To make the output, you have to...replace the gray boxes with the non-gray ones. You need to envision the gray columns/row repelling the non-gray boxes like they are opposite poles of a magnet.

3. To make the output, you have to...create a mirror image of the structure on the gray boxes without any relation to magnet-like attraction.

4. To make the output, you have to...remove the gray boxes and shift the non-gray boxes towards the central row as if they are magnets.

5. To make the output, you have to...redesign the entire structure with only gray boxes, disregarding the central row position.
