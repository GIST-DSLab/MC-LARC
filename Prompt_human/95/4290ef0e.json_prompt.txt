Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...reduce the size of each subsequent outline, and place them overlapping each other.

2. To make the output, you have to...remove the background completely, so only the outlines remain.

3. To make the output, you have to...scatter the outlines randomly, with different sizes and shapes.

4. To make the output, you have to...place the outlines inside each other so the big one contain all others within it, leave the background the same color.

5. To make the output, you have to...fill the outlines with different colors, creating a sort of rainbow effect.
