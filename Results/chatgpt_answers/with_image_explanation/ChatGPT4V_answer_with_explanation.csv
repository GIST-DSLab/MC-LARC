0,007bbfb7,4,"The correct option is: 1.

Explanation: The rule applied in the images clearly aligns with option 1. We can see that the output grid is a black 7x7 grid, and for each colored square in the 2x2 input grid, there is a corresponding 3x3 pattern replicated in the output grid. The number of times the pattern is replicated on the output grid is equal to the number of colored squares in the input grid, and the position of these patterns in the output grid directly corresponds to the location of the colored squares in the input grid. The pattern from the 2x2 grid is duplicated across the 7x7 grid according to the position of the colored squares in the input pattern, resulting in a specific arrangement of colored blocks in the output grid. None of the other options match the transformation process observed in the images, as they either reference different grid sizes, configurations, or incorrect correspondence between input and output patterns."
1,00d62c1b,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...examine the green pattern in the input. Identify any empty areas of blocks enclosed by the pattern and fill those enclosed parts with yellow.

Explanation: After looking at the given image files, it is clear that in each case, the output grid is created by filling in the empty spaces that are enclosed by the green pattern on the input grid with yellow color. There are no instances where the green pattern itself is filled with yellow, which eliminates option 5. Options 1 and 3 are incorrect as they mention grey and brown colors, which are not present in the grids. Option 2 is not applicable as it refers to examining the green pattern in the output, whereas we are looking for the rule that is applied to the input grid to create the output grid. Hence, the correct answer is option 4."
2,017c7c7b,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...identify a repeating blue pixel pattern in 6x3 grid pattern. And fill the repeated pattern with red pixels on a 9x3 grid.

Explanation: In the given images, we can see a vertical 6x3 grid pattern where blue squares alternate with black ones. This pattern repeats every three squares in a column. In the output, the same pattern is maintained, but the blue squares are replaced with red squares, and the grid size has been expanded to 9x3 to accommodate three repetitions of the original pattern. None of the other options match the pattern and color replacement observed in the transformation from input to output grids."
3,025d127b,3,"1. Explanation: Upon closely examining both sets of input and output grids, it is clear that the output is a shifted version of the input grid. Specifically, starting from the bottom of each colored shape, the row above is shifted one unit to the left. All other parts of the shape remain in the same position except for the blocks directly above the bottom row, which are moved as described. The pattern is consistent across all the different colored shapes within each grid. This shifting rule aligns with the first option provided."
4,045e512c,4,"2. To make the output, you have to...magnify the reference shape, starting from the color of the corner blocks and then repeat that pattern to the center of the grid, regardless of requiring an incomplete formation.

Explanation: Upon examining the images, the rule that seems to be applied is that the pattern in the input grid is expanded or magnified in the output grid, and the expansion starts from the color of the blocks located in the corners of the reference shape. This pattern is then repeated towards the center of the grid. In some cases, this results in the shape being completed, and in others, it remains incomplete.  
- In the first image, the pink blocks on the corner are expanded to the center of the grid, and the pattern repeats, leaving some incomplete formations.
- In the second image, the yellow block in the corner leads to a similar magnification towards the center of the grid, with red and blue blocks also following suit.
- In the third image, the green block in the corner is copied and expanded towards the center, with the red blocks doing the same."
5,0520fde7,1,"1. Explanation: After examining the images, it is clear that the output grid is formed by looking at both the left and right parts of the input grid. Both the left and right parts are 3x3, and the output grid is also 3x3. Where there is overlap of colored squares on both the left and right parts, those corresponding squares in the output grid are colored red. This is consistent across all three given examples, so option 1 is the correct answer choice."
7,05f2a901,5,"The correct option is: 5

Explanation:
In all the given images, the blue 2x2 square does not change its position in the grid from the input to the output. The red shape, originally placed elsewhere in the input grid, moves and ends up touching the blue 2x2 square, either vertically or horizontally, in the output grid. This is consistent with option 5, where the rule is to keep the blue 2x2 square in the same spot, and the red shape needs to move until it is touching the blue 2x2 square vertically or horizontally. Options 1, 2, 3, and 4 are not consistent with the rule observed in the images because there is no blue 3x3 rectangle or green 2x2 square present, and the red shape is the one that moves while the blue 2x2 square remains static."
8,06df4c85,4,"The correct option is 4. To make the output, you have to...fill the black 2x2 square grid with the same color in between the two same color of the 2x2 grid and connect.

Explanation: In all three image examples, the common pattern observed in the transformation from the input grid (left side) to the output grid (right side) is that the black 2x2 squares present between two 2x2 squares of identical colors are filled in with that same color. The filled color then spreads out in a + or cross shape to connect with the existing colored squares. This is consistently applied in all examples, aligning with option 4."
9,08ed6ac7,1,"The correct option is:

1. To make the output, you have to...change the color of the tallest to blue, then second tallest to red, third tallest to green, then finally shortest to yellow for both pairs.

Explanation: Upon examining the images, it can be observed that in the output grid, the color of the bars changes according to their height. The tallest bar is colored blue, followed by the second tallest in red, the third tallest in green, and the shortest bar in yellow. This rule applies to both sets of input and output grids provided in the images."
10,09629e4f,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...find the square that has only four color blocks in the pattern. Use that pattern to fill the blocks in the output. The gray areas stay the same.

Explanation: Upon examining the images, it can be seen that each output grid has retained a square pattern containing four color blocks from the input grid. The gray areas from the input grid are consistent and have stayed the same in the output grid. The other areas in the output grid have been filled with black color. Accordingly, option 3 correctly describes the transformation rule applied to obtain the output grid from the input grid."
11,0962bcdd,1,"1. Explanation: In the given image files, the output is created by extending the central plus sign one square in every direction. This results in a larger plus sign that is 5 squares long in each direction. At the center of this plus sign, a 5x5 'X' is created using the color of the center square in the input. This means there are nine squares of the center color (the 'X' plus the center square) and eight of the original plus sign color. This pattern is consistent in both image examples provided, with different colors being used in each. The description in option 1 matches this pattern precisely, with the center color extending out in an 'X' and the original plus sign color filling the remaining squares to create a larger shape."
12,0a938d79,3,"1. To make the output, you have to...create a pattern of short stripes alternating between the 2 colors. Start from the first colored pixel and create a line that goes to the opposite side using that color. Then go to the last colored pixel and do the same. Continue the pattern of stripes to the left direction for a long grid or go up for a tall grid all the way to the end.

Explanation: In each of the given images, we observe that the output is comprised of a regular pattern of short horizontal or vertical stripes that alternate between the two colors found in the input grid. The process described in option 1 aligns with the observed changes, such as starting from the first colored pixel and drawing a line to the opposite side in the color of the pixel. The direction of the pattern development (left for long grids, up for tall grids) also matches the pattern's expansion in the output grids. The alternate options either suggest a pattern of dots, involve three colors, mention creating a circle, or start from the incorrect pixel, none of which is supported by the evidence presented in the images."
13,0b148d64,1,"1. To make the output, you have to...distinguish between four sections colored in random patterns, and among these, identify the one section that is colored differently. Afterward, copy only the differently colored section into the output grid.

Explanation: In each image, the input grid is divided into four quadrants, each with its own color pattern. The output grid contains only one quadrant from the input grid. Upon examination, the rule is that the output grid displays the quadrant that has a different pattern from the other three. For example, in the first image, the top left, top right, and bottom right quadrants have red patterns while the bottom left quadrant has a green pattern, and the green pattern is the one used in the output grid. Similarly, in the second image, the differently colored quadrant (yellow) is copied to the output grid. The same rule applies to the third image, where the blue pattern is unique and is copied to the output grid."
14,0ca9ddb6,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...copy image exactly. Where there's a red square, put yellow squares at its corners (4 total). Where there's a blue square, put orange squares directly above and below it (4 total). Do nothing with light blue or pink squares.

Explanation: In each example provided, the input grid has been copied over to the output grid exactly as it is. For every red square in the input, four yellow squares have been added at each of its corners in the output. Similarly, for every blue square in the input, two orange squares have been added directly above and below it in the output. There is no mention or appearance of light blue or pink squares in the transformation, which corresponds to the ""Do nothing with light blue or pink squares"" part of the rule. The other options do not apply to the given transformation as they mention different colors and actions that are not depicted in the images."
15,0d3d703e,1,"The correct answer is: 

3. To make the output, you have to...maintain the color of the grid column. Grey stays grey, light blue stays light blue, pink stays pink, green stays green and vice versa.

Explanation: In each example, the columns of the input grid retain their original colors in the output grid. There is no swapping or changing of colors between different columns. Each column color is consistent between the input and output grids, indicating that the rule is to maintain the original color of each grid column."
16,0dfd9992,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...copy input grid exactly. Fill in all black boxes to draw establish pattern.

Explanation: In each image set, the output grid is a direct copy of the input grid with all the black boxes filled in to maintain the established pattern. There are no other alterations such as erasing, inverting, overlaying diagonally, or mirroring upside down. The colorful boxes remain unchanged, and only the black boxes are filled in to create a continuous pattern."
17,0e206a2e,2,"The correct option is 1. To make the output, you have to...try to leave the empty space between the three color boxes as the original object given.

Explanation: In each image, the transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves three colored boxes that are kept in their original configuration, with the empty space between them left intact. There are no new colors added, nor are the existing objects resized or moved extensively - they maintain the same arrangement and orientation. Therefore, option 1 is the correct rule that applies to all the given images."
18,10fcaaa3,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...copy the input. Then, resize the output grid to be double the width and height. Then, copy the upper-left quadrant of your output grid (which is the same as the input grid) and paste it once in each quadrant of the output grid. You should have 4x as many colored squares in the output as in the input. Then, for each colored square in the output, do the following: Add a light blue square 1 above and to the left, 1 above and to the right, 1 below and to the left, 1 below and to the right. Each light blue square should be diagonally touching the colored square, forming an X with the colored square in the center. Some of the X's might overlap or go off the screen. That is okay.

Explanation: The output grid is visibly double the size of the input grid in both width and height. The colored squares from the input are replicated in each quadrant of the output grid, resulting in four times the amount of colored squares in total. Additionally, light blue squares are added in a diagonal pattern in relation to each of the colored squares, creating an X shape with the colored square in the center. The provided set of images clearly follows this pattern, hence option 3 is the correct choice."
19,11852cab,3,"1. Explanation: In all the given image files, the input grid shows an incomplete pattern with different colored squares. To get to the output grid, the blank squares need to be filled with the correct color to complete the pattern symmetrically. The output grid shows that the same colors are used to complete the pattern by filling in the sides parallel to the ones that already have color in the input grid, thus making a symmetrical pattern."
20,1190e5a7,3,"The correct answer is: 1.

Explanation: Upon examining the given images, we can see that in each instance, the output grid retains the color of the predominant lines that dissect the input grid. For example, in the first image, the green lines delineate the grid, hence the output is entirely green, disregarding the orange color of the actual grid squares. The pattern holds true for the subsequent images as well, where the output grid assumes the main color of the lines (blue in the second image, green in the third) and omits the alternate line color and original grid square colors. 

Furthermore, the output grid simplifies the design of the input grid to a basic 2x3 configuration, disregarding the initial number of squares or lines. Essentially, the output grid consists of six sections, regardless of the original complexity of the input grid's segmentation. 

Therefore, Option 1 accurately captures both the color transformation rule and the structural adjustment required to generate the output grid from the input grid."
21,137eaa0f,2,"The correct option is: 3. To make the output, you have to...move each tile so that the gray square in each tile occupies the center square of the output 3x3 grid.

Explanation: In all the given images, the patterns from the input grid are rearranged in the output grid so that the gray square present in each pattern is moved to the center square of the output 3x3 grid. The other colored squares in each pattern maintain their relative positions to the gray square, filling the surrounding squares of the output grid accordingly. Options 1, 2, 4, and 5 do not accurately describe the transformation seen in the images, as they mention moving patterns, gray rectangles, or red squares to the center, which does not match the consistent placement of gray squares at the center in the output grids."
22,150deff5,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...fill in pattern completely with blue and red, to form 2x2 blue pattern and 1x3 red patterns.

Explanation: Upon examining the three given image pairs, it is clear that the output grids are filled with blue and red colors. The shapes formed by the blue cells in the output grids are 2x2 squares, while the shapes formed by the red cells are 1x3 rectangles. This rule is consistently applied in each example, where the original gray cells in the input grid are transformed into either a 2x2 blue square or a 1x3 red rectangle in the output grid. None of the other color combinations provided in the options are present in any of the output grids, which confirms that option 3 is the correct answer."
23,178fcbfb,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...draw a vertical red line through any red squares. Then draw lines, left to right, for the green and blue squares. Go over any red squares from before.

Explanation: In all three images, there is a vertical red line running through the grid wherever there is a red square in the input grid. After that, horizontal lines are drawn for the green and blue squares from left to right, and these lines cross over the red vertical line if they intersect. This pattern is consistent across all images, and therefore, option 3 is the correct answer."
24,1a07d186,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...remove the different color that does not match the rest. Move the single squares so they are in the same horizontal or vertical place depending if it is a vertical or horizontal line and have them touch the same side the single squares were on.

Explanation: In all three examples, there is a consistent pattern where the single square of a different color from the main line of squares is removed in the output grid. Additionally, the position of the single squares in relation to the main line is consistent; they remain in the same row or column and are moved to the edge of the grid, touching the side where the main line of squares is located. Therefore, among the provided options, number 5 is the rule that correctly transforms each input grid into the output grid."
25,1b2d62fb,1,"1. Explanation: The rule for creating the output from the input is to first change the whole background to black. Next, compare the black spaces in both input patterns and identify the black spaces that are similar in both. Then, color those similar black spaces with light blue color. This rule is clearly observed in all the given image examples where only the common black space between both input patterns is filled with light blue in the output grid."
26,1b60fb0c,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...draw with red color to follow the pattern of the blue section and make one figure with 4 sections that look the same.

Explanation: In all three images, you can see that a new figure with 4 connected sections has been created in red color. This figure follows a pattern where the original blue sections on the input grid do not exist on the output grid. Instead, the red figure seems to replace an area where the blue sections were in a specific pattern, creating a symmetry where the red sections are joined to form a single 4-section figure. Therefore, the correct answer is to follow the pattern of the blue sections but replace them with red while maintaining a symmetrical 4-section figure."
27,1bfc4729,1,"The correct option is 1.

Explanation: By examining both images, we can see a clear pattern that matches option 1. For both the blue-yellow and pink-orange examples:
- The top color (blue or pink) is used to fill the entire first row, the first and last blocks of the second row, the entire third row, and the first and last blocks of the fourth and fifth rows.
- The bottom color (yellow or orange) is used to fill the first and last blocks of the sixth and seventh rows, the entire eighth row, the first and last blocks of the ninth row, and the entire bottom (tenth) row.

This pattern applies to both input-output grid pairs, where the placement of colored blocks in the input grid does not seem to impact the pattern in the output grid. Thus, option 1 is the correct rule that has been applied to create the output grid from the input grid for both given images."
28,1c786137,4,"1. To make the output, you have to...copy the color and position of pattern inside of the different colored square border. And resize the grid to match the size of the copied pattern.

Explanation: In each of the examples provided, there is a colored square border inside the input grid (blue in the first image, red in the second image, and yellow in the third image). The pattern of colors within these borders is copied to the output grid. The output grid is then resized to match the size of the pattern that was inside the border. The colors and positions of the blocks outside the differently colored borders are not reflected in the output grid. This rule appears to be consistent across all three examples."
29,1caeab9d,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...keep the blue shape where it is, and move the red and yellow shapes up or down so that they are at the same level as the blue-colored shape.

Explanation: In all three images, the blue shape remains in its original position, while the red and yellow shapes move vertically (up or down) to align with the row that the blue shape occupies in the grid. There is no change in the horizontal position of any shapes, which eliminates options that involve moving shapes left or right. Additionally, the blue shape is the common shape that does not move in each transformation, and the other shapes align with it, which confirms that option 3 is the correct rule for the transformation."
30,1cf80156,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...make sure the colored image is exactly fit (top, bottom, left, right) in the new rectangular grid. No color change.

Explanation: The pattern observed in all three images is that the colored object in the input grid is transformed in such a way that it perfectly fits within the confines of the output grid while retaining its original color. The object is expanded or shrunk to align with the top, bottom, left, and right edges of the new grid without any gaps or overlaps, and there is no alteration to its color."
31,1e0a9b12,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...think of the grid as a black field and as the colored squares as being objects floating in space. Gravity is suddenly turned on and all of the block fall vertically to the bottom. That produces the correct output grid.

Explanation: In all three given image examples, the colored squares from the input grid have moved to the bottom of the grid in the output images, as though affected by gravity. There are no instances of the squares moving horizontally (ruling out option 5), nor do they stay stationary (ruling out option 4), and the field is not blue (ruling out option 2). The objects are also not referred to as circles (ruling out option 1). Option 3 accurately describes the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, where the colored squares have fallen to the bottom while maintaining their column alignment."
32,1e32b0e9,1,"The correct answer is 1. To make the output, you have to...replicate what is inside of the top left 5x5 grid throughout the rest of the 8 grid left. The color of these additional blocks should match the color of the block cut line.

Explanation: In each of the provided images, we observe that the pattern in the top left 5x5 grid is repeated throughout the remaining grids on the left side. Additionally, we notice that the color of the blocks beyond the initial 5x5 grid corresponds to the color of the lines that create the smaller grids within the larger grid. For example, in the first image, the blue lines correspond with the blue color that fills the 8 grids, repeating the pattern in the top left 5x5. The same observation applies to the other images, where the red and blue lines in the larger grid match the colors of the additional blocks that repeat the pattern of the top left 5x5 grid. None of the other options accurately describe this observed rule."
33,1f0c79e5,5,"5, Explanation: The correct rule seems to be to extend the pattern in the direction where the red square is located on the square. If more than one corner has a red square, extend all corners to the edge by the width of the square. The pattern ascends one unit and moves sideways by one unit, increasing its width by two units each step it takes towards the edge of the grid. This rule applies consistently to all the given images as we can observe that in each output, the pattern has expanded from the red square?™s position towards the edges in a uniform width increment, creating a diagonal stepped pattern. This rule is correctly described in option 5."
34,1f642eb9,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...make one similarly colored square inside the light blue figure for each colored square around the exterior. Place the colored squares along the most outer edge of the blue figure, closest to their corresponding block. 

Explanation: Each of the images shows a pattern where the central light blue figure must contain colored squares that match the colored blocks around the exterior of the entire grid. These colored squares are placed along the edge of the light blue figure that is closest to their respective exterior colored block, creating a straight line of the same color that extends to the edge of the light blue figure. This rule applies consistently across all three images."
35,1f85a75f,4,"The correct option is: 

3, Explanation: In both given images, the output grid is created by leaving the small dense part of colored squares in the input grid. For example, in the first image, a group of green squares is densely packed together in the input grid, and in the output grid, only that part is left while the rest is removed. Similarly, in the second image, a yellow dense group is left in the output while the rest is removed. This shows that the common rule is to leave the small dense part and remove all other parts to create the output grid."
36,1f876c06,4,"The correct option is 4.

Explanation: In each given image, we observe that the output grid has lines of the same color connecting two blocks that have been diagonally aligned. This rule holds true for all three examples provided. The colors of the blocks are not changing, and the lines are not vertical or horizontal. They are not multi-colored lines either. Therefore, the most appropriate option is number 4: To make the output, you have to...connect the two same colored blocks in a diagonal to create a same colored line."
37,1fad071e,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...fill single blue grid from the left for every 2x2 blue grids available.

Explanation: By examining the three given images, it is clear that in the output grid, a single blue box appears on the left side for every 2x2 set of blue boxes in the input grid. In the first image, the input grid has three sets of 2x2 blue boxes, which results in the output grid having the three blue boxes filled on the left side, followed by black empty boxes to the right. The second image shows that the output grid also corresponds to the three sets of 2x2 blue boxes in the input. The third image has two sets of 2x2 blue boxes, so the output grid has two blue boxes filled on the left. This pattern holds consistently across all the images, hence option 5 is the correct answer."
38,2013d3e2,2,"The correct answer is 2. Explanation: In both examples provided, the output grid is created by taking the 3x3 block of squares from the leftmost side of the input grid. The color of the first square in the large pattern (whether black or another color) does not affect this rule as it still applies. Thus, the rule that fits both images is to use the leftmost 9 squares of the large pattern to create the output."
39,2204b7a8,1,"The correct answer is: 1. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid. change the color of each pixel in the black field to the color of the border line that each pixel is closest to.

Explanation: In each image, the input grid has a single-colored border at the top and bottom or on the sides, with the rest of the grid being black. The colored blocks inside the black field of the input grid are changed to match the color of the closest border in the output grid. For example, in the first image, the green blocks that are closest to the blue top border are changed to blue in the output grid, while those closest to the red bottom border are changed to red. The same pattern is observed in the second and third images with different border colors but with the same rule applied."
40,22168020,4,"The correct option is:

4. To make the output, you have to...fill in the area above the four square base until you get to the top of the colored area.

Explanation: In all given images, the transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves extending the block of color upwards while maintaining the original width of the four squares at the base. The colored area is expanded vertically until it reaches the top of the grid. Option 4 is the only choice that correctly describes this pattern of filling the area above the four square base to the top of the colored area."

42,2281f1f4,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...use the grey squares as a reference to make red squares. Draw imaginary vertical lines for the gray pixels above the grid and imaginary horizontal lines for the gray pixels on the right. Fill in the pixels where these lines intersect with red color.

Explanation: By examining the three given images and comparing the input grids with the output grids, it's clear that the gray squares are used as reference points. Imaginary vertical lines are drawn from the gray squares that are above the main grid, and imaginary horizontal lines are drawn from the gray squares that are on the right side of the grid. Where these imaginary lines intersect, the corresponding squares in the grid are filled with red color. This pattern holds true for all three examples, which makes option 3 the correct answer."
43,228f6490,1,"The correct answer is: 
1. To make the output, you have to...take a colored shape to fill in the hole for each grey square. It will only take one shape per square.

Explanation: 
By examining the images, we can see that in the output grid, the colored shapes from the input grid are moved and used to fill the grey squares in the output grid. Each grey square is filled with a single colored shape, and the position of the shapes matches the pattern of where the grey squares were in the input grid. No grey squares are left empty, and all colored shapes are used exactly once, matching the description of option 1."
44,22eb0ac0,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...copy the input. If two blocks across from each other are the same color, fill in the rest of that horizontal row with that color. Don't do anything with the blocks across from each other that are different colors.

Explanation: In all three given image examples, we can see that the output is generated by filling in the entire row with the same color if the two blocks on either end of that row are of the same color. For example, in the first image, we see a red block on one end of a row and another red block directly across from it on the other end; the entire row is then filled with red in the output grid. This rule is consistent with all the rows that have matching colored blocks on each end in all the provided images. If the blocks on the ends of the row are different colors, as seen in the third image, the row is left unchanged in the output grid."
45,234bbc79,1,"1. To make the output, you have to...make any grey boxes the same color as the blocks to which it is connected. Remove columns of black boxes. Align the middle and right shapes so that the former grey squares are connected.

Explanation: By examining the images provided, we can observe a consistent rule applied across all examples. In the input grid, where there are grey boxes adjacent to colored boxes, these grey boxes change to match the color of the adjacent colored boxes in the output grid. Additionally, columns of black boxes that do not contain any colored boxes are removed in the transformation to the output grid. Finally, the remaining colored shapes in the output grid are aligned in such a manner that what used to be grey squares in the input grid are connected to the same colored blocks in the output grid, maintaining continuity of color and shape. The other options either introduce actions that are not in the images (changing colors to different ones, removing rows instead of columns, misaligning shapes, and adding columns) or mention a color (green) that does not play a specific role. Therefore, option 1 is the correct answer."
46,23581191,2,"2. To make the output, you have to...extend both colored squares left and right, and up and down across the board to form two lines. The square should be red where the lines intersect.

Explanation: In the given images, the orange and blue squares are extended vertically and horizontally to create continuous lines going across the grid. Where these two lines intersect, the square is changed in color to red. Option 2 correctly describes this common rule for creating the output grid from the input grid. The other options do not accurately reflect the transformation seen in the images."
47,239be575,5,"None of the provided options seem to correctly describe the transformation from the input grid to the output grid based on the images provided, as the output grid is completely filled with a single color. Therefore, I cannot select any of the given options. 

However, looking at the images, it seems the rule to create the output grid from the input grid is to fill the entire output grid with the color that is in the majority in the input grid. If this were an option, it would be the correct choice. 

Explanation: In each input grid, there is one color that appears more frequently than the others (either black, red, or blue). The corresponding output grid is entirely filled with this majority color."
48,23b5c85d,3,"The correct option is: 

3. To make the output, you have to...copy the exact colored object in the small inner grid pattern.

Explanation: 

In each example, the output grid highlights a specific colored object that is also present in the input grid. As we look at the input grid, we observe a smaller object within the grid, which is entirely shaded with a single color that is distinct from the rest of the grid pattern. This specific smaller object from the input grid is the one that is replicated as the entire pattern in the output grid. 

For instance, in the first image, the small blue square object in the bottom corner of the input grid is copied to fill the entire output grid. In the second image, the small blue ""T"" shape pattern in the input grid is copied to fill the entire output grid. In the third image, the small orange square in the center of the input grid is copied to fill the entire output grid. And finally, in the last image, the small yellow square pattern in the upper right corner of the input grid is copied to fill the entire output grid.

This pattern of copying the small colored object and using it to fill the output grid is consistent across all given image examples, making option 3 the correct choice."
49,253bf280,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...use green lines to connect light blue dots that are in the same line.

Explanation: In each of the given images, the input grid shows light blue dots placed at different positions, and the output grid displays green lines connecting these dots in a straight line. These connected dots appear either in the same row or column. There are no red, brown, gray, or yellow lines used, and the dots are not brown or pink, nor are they diagonally aligned. Therefore, the only rule that fits the transformation from the input grid to the output grid is option 5, where green lines are used to connect light blue dots that share the same row or column, creating a straight line."
50,25d487eb,3,"The correct answer is option 1: To make the output, you have to...take the medium color and eject it out the side.

Explanation: In all three example images, the medium-sized colored block from the input grid is extended all the way to the edge of the output grid on the right side, effectively ""ejecting"" it out the side. In the first image, the medium-sized red block is extended to the right. In the second image, the medium-sized green block is extended downward. In the third image, the medium-sized blue block is extended to the right. The common rule in all these transformations is extending the medium-sized colored block out to the side of the grid."
51,25d8a9c8,4,"3. To make the output, you have to...fill the row with grey if the row has different colors in the input. Color the row with black if the row contain the same colors.

Explanation: In all of the images, rows that have squares of different colors in the input grid are filled with grey in the output grid, while rows that have squares of the same color in the input grid are filled with black in the output grid. This pattern is consistent across all the examples provided, making option 3 the correct answer."
52,25ff71a9,4,"The correct option is: 

4. To make the output, you have to...move all the color down by one grid.

Explanation: In all the given image files, the colored squares in the input grid are moved down by one grid to create the output grid. For example, in the first image, the three blue squares that are on the top row of the input grid are moved down to the middle row in the output grid. Similarly, in the second image, the two blue squares on the middle row are moved down to the bottom row in the output grid. This pattern continues in the third and fourth images as well, where the blue and red squares, respectively, are moved down by one grid to generate the output grid. Hence, the common rule for creating the output grid from the input grid is to move all the colored squares down by one grid."
53,264363fd,2,"I'm sorry, but I cannot assist with this task as the content required to complete the task is not visible to me."
54,272f95fa,2,"1. To make the output, you have to...fill the areas separated by 5 lines. Center area should be filled with magenta, and top area with red, the left with yellow, the right with green, and the bottom with blue, relative to the center area.

Explanation: In both given images, the input grid has a specific design consisting of a pattern separated by 5 distinct lines creating a cross shape. This pattern is then transferred to the output grid where each of the 5 areas created by these lines is filled with a specific color. The center of the cross is always filled with magenta, with the surrounding areas colored red at the top, yellow to the left, green to the right, and blue at the bottom, maintaining the same respective spatial positions as described in the given option. The consistent application of this rule in both image examples provided confirms that option 1 is the correct answer."
55,27a28665,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...consider the pattern of the colored boxes. Where the colored boxes form a cross, the output color should be pink. Where there are three colored boxes at the top left corner the output color should be blue. Where there are four colored boxes at the top right the output color should be green. Where the colored boxes are at the middle of each of the first and third column and in the middle column the colored boxes are at the top and bottom, the output color should be red.

Explanation: The pattern of the colored boxes dictates the output color, and it is consistent across all four images. In the first image, the boxes form a cross and the output color is pink. In the second image, three boxes are located at the top left corner and the output is blue. In the third image, four boxes are at the top right and the output color is green. Lastly, in the fourth image, boxes are located in the middle of the first and third columns, and at the top and bottom of the middle column, resulting in a red output."
56,28bf18c6,5,"The correct option is:

4. To make the output, you have to...duplicate the different pattern twice vertically.

Explanation: In each of the given examples, the colored pattern from the input grid (on the left) has been duplicated twice vertically in the output grid (on the right). This creates two exact copies of the pattern, one above the other, resulting in a vertically extended version of the original pattern. The duplication maintains the same colors and positions relative to each other, just expanded vertically."
57,28e73c20,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...create a green pattern. Start in the upper left and go right. Hit the corner and go down. Continue in clockwise order. When you hit green, stop one blocks away and continue in the pattern. End in the center.

Explanation: The output grid from each image shows a green pattern that starts in the upper left corner and proceeds right. When it reaches the edge, it goes down and continues in a clockwise spiral manner. The rule described in option 4 matches this pattern precisely. When the green squares come into contact with other green squares already filled, the pattern stops one block before the filled green square and continues in the same spiral pattern. This results in a distinct spiral shape seen in the output grids. Options 1, 2, 3, and 5 do not match the pattern observed in the output grids and therefore can be eliminated."
58,29623171,4,"The correct option is: 

4. To make the output, you have to...find the black box or boxes with the highest number of colored blocks in the input grid. The corresponding box or boxes in the output grid should be colored entirely that color. The rest of the boxes should be all black.

Explanation: In each of the provided images, the output grid shows the black box with the highest number of colored blocks from the input grid entirely filled with that color. All other boxes in the output grid are black. 

- In the first image, the top right black box contains 4 red blocks, which is the highest in the grid and hence is filled entirely with red in the output grid. 
- In the second image, the bottom right black box contains 6 green blocks, the highest in the grid, so it is filled entirely in green in the output grid.
- In the third image, the bottom right black box contains 4 blue blocks, the highest in the grid, so it is filled entirely in blue in the output grid."
59,29c11459,5,"3. To make the output, you have to...move blue to the left to make 5 blue. Move red to right to make 5 red. Present with color square.

Explanation: Observing the provided images, we can see that in each case, the colored squares move towards the center from opposite ends of the grid. The number of colored squares increases such that there are 5 squares of each color in the output grid, positioned in a contiguous sequence. There are 5 blue squares in a row from the left edge and 5 red squares in a row from the right edge, with a single gray square in between them in the output grid. This rule is satisfied by option 3, as it correctly states that 5 of each color (blue and red) need to be moved and aligned as per the described output grid arrangement."
60,29ec7d0e,2,"The correct option is: 

2. To make the output, you have to...replace the black squares with the correct corresponding colors, using the blocks without black areas as reference.

Explanation: 
Upon inspecting the input and output images, we can see that the only difference is that the output image is devoid of the black squares present in the input image. Every black square in the input has been replaced with a colored square in the output. By looking at the pattern of colors in the blocks that do not have any black squares, we can determine the color that should replace each black square in the blocks that do contain them. Therefore, option 2 is the correct answer. The other options do not correctly describe the transformation from the input to the output."
61,2bcee788,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...take the shape with more blocks and copy it exactly onto the output grid in the same color, then reflect it in the direction of the smaller shape. So, you have an exact reflection of the larger shape. Color the rest of the background light green.

Explanation: In each of the given images, we observe that the shape with more blocks (the larger shape) is copied onto the output grid without change in color. After that, the larger shape is reflected in the direction where the smaller shape is located relative to the larger shape in the input grid. This reflection is an exact copy of the larger shape, with no distortion. The rest of the background in the output grid is filled with a light green color as observed in each example."
62,2bee17df,2,"The correct answer is 2.

Explanation: In each image, there are blue squares around the perimeter of the grid which are only one square deep. In the output grid, green lines are drawn connecting these ""one-deep"" squares along the horizontal and vertical axes. The green lines only connect to other squares that are also one square deep, and they are drawn through the center areas, which consist of black squares. This pattern is consistent in all three images provided. The other options' descriptions do not accurately reflect the transformation seen in the images."
63,2c608aff,1,"The correct option is:

1. To make the output, you have to...connect it with the same color as the dot if the dots could connect to the central square with a straight line.

Explanation: Looking at the provided images, we can see that the output images have lines drawn connecting the dots to the central colored square when it is possible to draw a straight line between the dot and the central square without passing through another colored square. The lines and the central square are colored the same color as the dots being connected. For example, in the first image, the red and yellow dots can draw straight lines to the central yellow square, so they are connected. In the second image, the yellow dots can connect to the central grey square through straight lines. In the third and fourth images, blue lines are drawn to the central blue squares. Therefore, the rule described in option 1 correctly explains the transformation from the input grid to the output grid."
64,2dc579da,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...select the quadrant with the different colored square, then copy and paste the quadrant as the output.

Explanation: In all three examples given, the output grid is a result of identifying the quadrant in the input grid that contains the square with a distinct color (different from the other squares in that quadrant), then copying that entire quadrant and pasting it to create the output grid. The other squares in the output grid have been removed or are not present in the output."
65,2dd70a9a,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...start at the green colored area, draw a line to red area. When the green line meets sky blue area, turn left or right toward red area.

Explanation: By examining all three examples provided, the pattern that emerges is the green line always starts at the green square and makes its way toward the red square. Whenever the green line encounters a sky blue square, it turns in a direction (either left or right) that allows it to continue its path towards the red square without interruption. There are no yellow, brown, or gray squares to start from or head towards in the examples given, and the blue squares do not factor into the movement of the green line, eliminating options 1, 2, 4, and 5."
66,2dee498d,5,"The correct option is: 5. To make the output, you have to...fill the grid up with the singular identified pattern.

Explanation: In each of the given image sets, the output grid appears to be generated by identifying a repeating pattern of colors in each row of the input grid and then filling the output grid with the same pattern of colors, but in a way that fills up the grid from the bottom. For example, in the first image, the bottom row of the input grid is red-green alternating, and in the output grid, the bottom half is filled with this pattern. The same goes for the second image with the blue-yellow pattern and the third image with the red-yellow-blue-black pattern. The output grid takes the identified pattern and fills it up from the bottom, thereby correctly applying option 5."
67,31aa019c,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...make the entire output grid black. Then find the block in the input grid that is the only one of that color and place it in the same position in the output grid. Then surround that block with blocks of the bright red-orange color.

Explanation: In each image, the output grid is entirely black. In the first image, the yellow block is the only one of its color in the input grid and is placed in the same position in the output grid, surrounded by the bright red-orange color blocks. The same rule applies to the second image with the pink block and to the third image with the green block, which are both unique in their color in the input grid and surrounded by red-orange blocks in the output grid. None of the other options provided match the observed pattern in all three images."
68,321b1fc6,1,"2, Explanation: In both given images, the light blue patterns in the input grid are replaced with orange and pink patterns in the output grid, with each pattern maintaining the same shape but changing the color. The original light blue patterns are then turned into black tiles, effectively removing them from the output grid. This matches the description of option 2."
69,32597951,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...replace the blue squares with green squares to complete a square of a rectangle with the light blue blocks.

Explanation: Upon examining the given images, we can observe that the pattern of blue squares in the input grid forms an incomplete rectangle. In the output grid, the missing squares necessary to complete the rectangle are filled in with green squares. No other shapes such as yellow squares, red squares, hexagons, or circles are involved in the transformation. None of the other options accurately describe the rule applied to create the output grid from the input grid, therefore option 3 is the correct choice."
70,3345333e,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...remove the unnecessary pattern box in the single color pattern.

Explanation: In both provided images, the transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves removing the pattern boxes that are filled with a single color that is different from the rest of the pattern. In the first image, the blue box is removed from the input grid, leaving only the pink pattern in the output grid. In the second image, the green box is removed from the input grid, leaving only the red pattern in the output grid. Thus, the common rule is removing the box pattern that is filled with a non-matching single color, such that the remaining pattern consists of one uniform color."
71,3428a4f5,2,"1. To make the output, you have to...overlap the two patterns, if the colors are the same then it is colored black. if they are different then they are colored in the same color.

Explanation: Upon close observation, it is clear that where the red and yellow squares from the input grid overlap, they result in the same colored green squares in the output grid. However, where the black squares from the input grid overlap with any colored square (red or yellow), they result in black squares in the output grid. This indicates the rule that when overlapping, if the colors are the same, they become black, but if they are different, they take on the non-black color (in this case, green)."
72,3618c87e,1,"The correct option is:
1. To make the output, you have to...take the blue dots and place them two squares down, with the background still fully black.

Explanation:
Upon close examination of the given images, we can see that in each case, the blue squares in the input grid have been moved exactly two squares down to create the output grid. Also, the background remains fully black in both the input and output grids. The other options provided do not match the changes observed between the input and output grids as they mention different colors (such as red or yellow) or different amounts of square movements (such as three squares down), or a change in the background color (such as turning fully gray or brown), none of which are applicable in this scenario."
73,3631a71a,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid to the output grid. You will see boxes where the pattern is missing. In these boxes, mirror the pattern from the opposite side of the grid, exactly. Use the same colors.

Explanation: By carefully examining the images, we can see that the patterns on the input grid are mirrored on the output grid in specific boxes where the pattern is missing. The mirrored patterns are taken from the directly opposite side of the grid, maintaining the exact replica, including the colors. The missing patterns on one side appear filled on the opposite side, suggesting a rule of mirroring the opposite side's pattern exactly with the same colors in the specified areas."
74,363442ee,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...use the blue square as the middle square and recreate the same pattern replacing the blue square with the same color in the middle as the pattern.

Explanation: In each image, the blue square is consistently located in the middle of a block of four squares. In the output grid, the pattern around the blue square is copied and rotated, with the blue square replaced by another square of the same color. Even in the cases where the blue square might not be exactly in the middle of the grid, it serves as a reference point for the pattern that needs to be replicated and the output follows the same rule of replacing the blue square with another of the same color."
75,36d67576,1,"2, Explanation: For all given image files, the transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves repeating the pattern shown on the single green square block(s) onto the other color blocks in the grid. In each case, the green block acts as a template for the reconfiguration of the other blocks in the grid, maintaining their original color but conforming to the shape and orientation of the green block. This rule is consistent across all three examples."
76,36fdfd69,4,"4. Explanation: In the provided image files, the consistent change from the input grid to the output grid is the completion of the structure formed by the red grids. These red grids are arranged in a shape that closely resembles a rectangle or a square in each example. The rule is to identify the complete rectangular or square shape that the red grids would form if continued, and then change the overlapping color within this shape to yellow. All other grids remain unchanged from the input. This rule is correctly described in option 4."
77,3906de3d,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...imagine the blue is a vacuum and sucks the red up into the open spaces. Move all red straight up.

Explanation: In all the given images, the red blocks move directly upwards into the nearest available empty black spaces, while the blue blocks remain stationary. This movement suggests that the blue blocks are pulling the red blocks upwards, consistent with the idea of a vacuum effect as described in option 4. Options 1, 2, 3, and 5 are incorrect as they refer to the wrong colors or incorrect movements (pushing down instead of pulling up, for example). The consistency across all images supports the idea that option 4 correctly describes the rule for creating the output grid from the input grid."
78,39a8645d,4,"The correct answer is 2.

Explanation: When comparing the input and output grids for each image, we see that in the output grid, one color is zoomed in and fills up the grid, while the other colors are not present. To determine which color is chosen:

- In the first image, the blue color has the most copies (5), and the output grid is entirely blue.
- In the second image, the light blue color has the most copies (5), and the output grid is entirely light blue.
- In the third image, the yellow color has the most copies (8), and the output grid is entirely yellow.

This pattern indicates that to make the output, we need to count the number of copies of each color and zoom in on the color with the most copies in the grid. Hence, option 2 is correct."
79,39e1d7f9,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid, replicate the main pixel placement within the grid and replicate half at the top right corner.

Explanation: By examining the given images, we can see that the output grid is almost a copy of the input grid with the exact colors and placement of pixels. The main pixel structure (larger colored squares) present in the input grid is replicated in the output grid, and half of this pattern, specifically the top right half, is replicated again within the same output grid, overlapping and creating a slight 3D effect. There is no change in the positioning of the main pixels, no misplacement, scrambling, or elimination, hence option 3 is the correct one."
80,3aa6fb7a,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...fill in the missing corners with a blue square.

Explanation: In each provided image, the output grid is created by adding blue squares to the corners of a larger shape or pattern that is suggested by the existing blue squares in the input grid. The other options are incorrect because they mention either red or green squares, or filling in edges or sides, which is not the case in the given images."
81,3ac3eb23,2,"The correct answer for both given image files is: 

1. To make the output, you have to...take it as 5 columns for each square and fill as a checkers pattern.

Explanation: In both examples, the output grid shows a pattern that resembles a checkers board where every other square is filled with a color. This pattern is created by dividing the grid into 5 columns from any colored square in the input grid and filling in the respective squares in the output grid to achieve the checkers pattern. In the first image, there is one yellow square in the input grid; using this yellow square as the starting point, we fill every other square in the respective 5 columns to create the checkers pattern in the output grid. Similarly, in the second image, there are two colored squares (red and blue) in the input grid, and taking them as the starting points, we fill every other square in their respective 5 columns to create the checkers pattern in the output grid with the corresponding colors."
82,3af2c5a8,5,"1. To make the output, you have to...imagine grid is cut in half vertical. Copy pattern to top and above right half. Mirror pattern to left half of grid to top and below.

Explanation: In the given images, we can observe that the pattern in the left half of the input grid is copied to the right half of the output grid, both above and below the central horizontal line. Additionally, the pattern is mirrored on the left half of the output grid, again both above and below the central horizontal line. This observation corresponds to option 1, which indicates that we need to copy and mirror the pattern from the vertically halved grid."
83,3bd67248,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...make a yellow line perpendicular to the line located at the left half and then you draw a diagonal red line starting at the intersecting between both lines.

Explanation: In each of the given image examples, a yellow line appears at the bottom of the grid, spanning the full width of the grid, and a red diagonal line begins at the intersection of the vertical edge of the grid and the yellow line, stretching towards the upper right of the grid. The yellow line is perpendicular to the left edge of the grid, while the red line cuts diagonally across the squares. This pattern holds true for all three image examples, making option 5 the correct choice."
84,3bdb4ada,4,"4, Explanation: In both images provided, we can observe that the transformation from input to output involves adding black squares within the rectangle shapes, alternating with the original colored squares. Specifically, the pattern follows a sequence where a colored square is immediately followed by a black square, then another colored square, and so on. The resulting pattern is consistently applied in the middle of each rectangle shape. The other options suggesting the addition of yellow, gray, or blue squares or altering only the top or bottom rows of the rectangles do not match the observed transformation in the images provided. Therefore, option 4 is the correct answer, as it accurately describes the rule needed to create the output grid from the input grid."
85,3befdf3e,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...copy the original input and paste it in the output. Then inverse the colors, then add the amount of squares that filled the input square to each side, inverse the color. Do not worry about the corners.

Explanation: In the given images, the transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves the following steps:
- Copy the input grid pattern exactly as it is onto the output grid.
- Inverse the colors of the original pattern (switch the colors to their opposite).
- Count the number of squares that form the original pattern (e.g., 3x3, 2x2, etc.).
- Starting from the center of the pattern in the output grid, add an equal number of squares on each side of the pattern with the inverted color, making sure to not fill in the corners. This essentially creates an enlarged version of the input pattern with an additional layer of squares on each side.
- Finally, inverse the color of the added squares.

In all examples, this rule holds true; the original pattern is duplicated, the colors are switched, an additional layer of squares matching the size of the input pattern is added to each side (without filling the corners), and then the colors are switched again."
86,3c9b0459,5,"The correct option is 5.

5, Explanation: Upon examining the images, it can be observed that the output grid has been rotated 180 degrees clockwise from the input grid. In other words, the output grid appears as if the input grid has been flipped upside down. This is evident because the colors in the corners and center of the grid remain the same, but their positions are mirrored across the central horizontal and vertical axes, which is characteristic of a 180-degree rotation. By applying this rule to all the given image examples, we can confirm that the output grids are indeed the result of rotating the input grids by 180 degrees clockwise."
87,3de23699,2,"1. To make the output, you have to...change the color of the colored shape to the color of the four edge squares.

Explanation: Upon inspection of the provided image files, it is clear that for each input grid, the colored shapes (regardless of their specific shape or color) in the input are changed to a single color in the output. This new color is determined by the color of the squares located at the midpoint of each edge of the grid, which are identical in each example. The other squares, including those in the corners, do not influence the color transformation in these examples. Hence, option 1 is the accurate rule that is applied to create the output grid from the input grid."
88,3e980e27,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...copy the placement and color of the pixels surrounding the red or green pixels that are not alone to the pixels that are alone. If the pixel is green the placement and color of the surrounding pixels should be the same as the surrounded green pixel. This should be applied to all solo green pixels. The same should be done with the red pixels, but the placement of the surrounding pixels should be mirrored horizontally.

Explanation: By examining the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, one can observe that standalone pixels (either red or green) have their surrounding pixels changed in the output grid; this change replicates the pattern of pixels (of the same color) that are in a group. For the solo green pixel in each example, the placement and color are copied directly from the group of green pixels. For the standalone red pixel, the group of red pixels appears to be mirrored horizontally to achieve the output pattern. The options related to other colors (yellow, blue, light blue, black, pink, gray, brown) do not match the patterns observed in the images. Hence, option 4 is the correct answer."
89,3eda0437,1,"1. To make the output, you have to...examine the grid, find the black squares that will allow for a symmetrical shape of either a square or rectangle, and color those squares pink.

Explanation: In each example, the output grid is created by identifying a symmetrical shape made up of black squares in the input grid, usually rectangular in these examples, and then coloring those specific squares pink to create the output grid. No other colored squares are changed, and no asymmetrical shapes or shapes other than squares and rectangles are colored. Additionally, there are no green squares present, and the shapes are not circles or ellipses, which eliminates the other options."
90,3f7978a0,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...make new grid between two gray lines and adjacent light blue pixels.

Explanation: In all the given images, the pattern that appears to be common is that a gray column is created in the output grid in the exact vertical alignment where there are light blue pixels in the input grid. This rule holds true for all the given examples, where each light blue pixel in the input grid corresponds to a gray cell in the output grid, regardless of the position or number of light blue pixels in the input grid. The other color and line options provided (yellow, green, brown, red) are not present in the images, which is why the correct answer is option 3."
91,40853293,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...connect similar colors with that color. where they overlap you should use the vertical color.

Explanation: By looking at the given images, it is clear that in the output grid, similar colors are connected by extending the colored squares vertically or horizontally. Where same-colored squares overlap, the square that extends vertically dictates the color. For instance, in the first image, there is a green square that extends horizontally and overlaps with a vertically extended green square, the area of the overlap uses the color from the vertical green square. The same applies to other colors in both examples, confirming that option 3 is the correct rule applied to create the output grid from the input grid."
92,4093f84a,5,"The correct option is: 

5. To make the output, you have to...copy the gray itself. Imagine the non-gray boxes are attracted to the gray columns/row like magnets, so change the non-gray boxes to gray and remove the difference between so that each now gray box is touching the central row.

Explanation: In all given images, the central row or column that was originally gray remains in the same position in the output grid, while the colored boxes surrounding it change color to gray. This suggests that the rule involves attracting the non-gray boxes to the central gray row or column and then changing their color to gray, so they are indistinguishable from the original gray row or column. This creates a continuous band of gray boxes touching the central row or column, which is consistent with all the images provided."
93,41e4d17e,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...find the center of each square and add a magenta pixel to its center. From that magenta pixel draw a line from each side of it (up, down, left, right) going straight to the border of the entire grid. Each magenta line must reach the border of the square. The magenta lines are allowed to cross over each other.

Explanation: In the given images, the patterns in the input grid are blue squares. Looking at the output grid, we can see that at the center of each of these blue squares, a magenta pixel has been added. From that pixel, magenta lines extend up, down, left, and right to the borders of the entire grid, not just stopping at the border of the individual squares. These lines also intersect with each other, which confirms that crossing is allowed. None of the other rules fit this pattern, making option 4 the correct choice."
94,4258a5f9,4,"The correct option is 4. To make the output, you have to...surround each of the grey boxes with a blue border.

Explanation: In the given images, the input grid shows grey boxes at different positions. In the corresponding output grids, each grey box is surrounded by additional boxes colored in blue, effectively creating a blue border around the grey box. There are no pink, yellow, red, or green borders present in the images, and the blue boxes are not surrounded by grey borders, which eliminates options 1, 2, 3, and 5. The only rule that applies to the transformation from the input to the output grid, as shown in these images, is option 4."
95,4290ef0e,4,"I'm sorry, I cannot assist with that request."
96,42a50994,1,"4. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid, identify which pixels are not connected or touching any other and change background colors of single pixels to the background color or black.

Explanation: Upon examining the images provided, we can see that the output grid retains only those colored pixels that are touching one another in the input grid. Any pixel that is isolated from others (i.e., not touching any other pixel of the same color on any of its four sides) has been changed to the background color, which is black. This rule applies consistently across all the examples given, where single pixels or groups of pixels that are separated from others are removed in the output grid."
97,4347f46a,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...replace all colored blocks inside the rectangular shapes with black so there is only a colored outline of the shapes.

Explanation: In all three sets of images, the transformation from the input grid to the output grid shows that the colored shapes retain their outlines but the insides are filled with black. This can be observed in the first image with the yellow and grey squares, the second image with the red square, and the third image with the blue, green, pink, and orange rectangles. The outermost colored blocks remain, creating an outline, while the inside blocks are changed to black. This matches with option 4."
98,444801d8,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...fill the inside of the blue square border with a single colored pixel. Then, you also fill the pixels where the blue square border is open, and draw a single line on top of the border's upper edge.

Explanation: In all three given images, the output grid shows a transformation where the inside of a blue square border is filled with a single colored pixel. The single colored pixel corresponds to the color of the single pixel that is different from the others within the blue square in the input grid (e.g., red in the first image, magenta in the second image, green in the third image). Additionally, there is a new line drawn on top of the upper edge of the blue square in the output grid, which aligns with the option's description. The rule consistently applies to all given images, making option 5 the correct answer."
99,445eab21,2,"2. To make the output, you have to...fill the entire 2x2 grid with the same color of the biggest square pattern that is in the original.

Explanation: In all three given images, the output is a 2x2 grid filled with a single color. This color corresponds to the color of the largest square pattern in each of the input grids. In the first image, there is a large blue square pattern, and the output is a 2x2 grid entirely filled with blue. In the second image, the largest square pattern is yellow, so the output grid is entirely yellow. In the third image, the largest square pattern is orange, thus the output grid is filled with orange. Hence, the rule is to fill the entire 2x2 output grid with the color of the largest square pattern from the input grid."
100,447fd412,4,"The correct answer is:

4. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid, then copy the pattern based on the red part of the completed object. However, all the positions of the existing red pixels must remain fixed. Also, if the size has increased, increase the size of the pattern proportionally.

Explanation: In the given images, the rule seems to be that the red squares in the output grid are duplicated, and their positions remain fixed. The blue squares are moved to the adjacent positions as seen in the input grid. From the examples provided, the closest option that describes this rule is option 4, as it mentions the duplication of the red objects and the positions remaining fixed. The sizes of the pattern are not relevant in this particular rule."
101,44d8ac46,1,"The correct option is: 

1. To make the output, you have to...fill the black area within the gray with red if it is a square; otherwise, leave it alone.

Explanation: In each of the given image sets, the output grid has the areas which are perfectly square and surrounded by gray filled in red. If the black area is not a perfect square as in the third image set, it is left as is, without any color fill. This consistent rule applies to all of the image sets provided. Options 2-5 are incorrect as they mention colors and shapes that are not present in the given images."
102,44f52bb0,5,"5, Explanation: The common rule for creating the output grid from the input grid in each given image is to fill in the pixels with blue if the input grid is symmetrical, and with orange if the input grid is not symmetrical. 

In the first image, the two red squares do not mirror each other across any axis, hence the pattern is not symmetrical, resulting in an orange output grid. In the second image, both red squares are on the same side, which also does not form a symmetrical pattern, hence the output is orange. In the third image, there is one red square at the centre; this is not symmetrical across vertical or horizontal axis, resulting in an orange output. Finally, the fourth image has a symmetrical pattern, as the red squares are mirrored across the vertical centre line, resulting in a blue output grid."
103,4522001f,2,"2, Explanation: The correct answer is option 2. In both given images, we observe the input grids (2x2) with one red and one green square, and the output grids (9x9) with two larger green squares (4x4) placed diagonally from one another. The position of the red square in the input grid's diagonal indicates the corner in which to place one of the green squares in the output grid. The position of the green square in the input grid shows which corner of this first green square, another green square of the same size will touch in the output grid. Each input pattern has been translated into the output grid with two green 4x4 squares that are touching each other corner to corner, fulfilling the described rule."
104,4612dd53,1,"1. To make the output, you have to...reconnect the sides of the rectangle(s). Use red to fill in the missing pieces of the sides in a straight line, rebuilding the rectangle(s). You should end up with one or two rectangles.

Explanation: In each of the given images, we observe that the output grid is formed by restoring the continuity of the broken sides of the blue rectangles from the input grid. The broken sides are reconnected by using red color to complete the structure of the rectangle(s). This results in either a single or a pair of completed rectangles with red sides integrated with the original blue sides. Hence, the rule that is applied here is to reconnect the sides of the rectangle(s) using red color to rebuild their complete form."
105,46442a0e,3,"The correct option is: 

3. To make the output, you have to...create a grid twice the size of the input. Divide the output grid into 4 quadrants. Replicate the input grid pixels in the upper right quad. In the upper left quad, place the input grid that's been rotated clockwise 90 degrees. In the lower right quad, place the input grid colored pixels that has been rotated 180 degrees. In the lower left quad place a copy of the input grid that's been rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

Explanation: 
Examining the given image files, it is clear that the output grid is indeed twice the size of the input, dividing naturally into four quadrants. The upper right quadrant in each example matches the input grid exactly. The upper left quadrant appears to be the input grid but rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The lower right quadrant is the input grid rotated 180 degrees, so it appears upside-down. Finally, the lower left quadrant shows the input grid rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. 

All other options either describe an incorrect grid size or mention rotation and placement that do not match the provided images. Option 3 is the only one that accurately describes the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in all given examples."
106,469497ad,4,"The correct answer is 4. Explanation: based on the given images, we can deduce the following rule. The output pattern size remains unchanged, no need to resize the grid. A border of red squares is added to the right and bottom side of the output grid, the number of squares being added based on the number of different colors within the input minus the black squares (for instance, if the input has 4 colored squares, then 4 red squares are added on each side). Then, small orange squares are sprinkled within this border according to the position of their same-colored squares in the input grid. The position of the orange squares in the output grid seems to correlate with the position of the non-black squares in the input grid - they are placed at the respective row and column number counting from the opposite edges of the grid."
107,46f33fce,2,"3, Explanation: Examining the provided images, it becomes apparent that individual colored 1x1 pixels expand to form larger 2x2 squares in the bottom-right direction. After the expansion, the overall grid size doubles while the now enlarged colored pixels remain as 1x1 pixels in the new grid. The crucial observation is that while the position of these colored pixels changes relative to the whole grid, their layout is maintained. Therefore, the only rule that matches this pattern accurately is option 3."
108,47c1f68c,1,"The correct answer is: 

1. To make the output, you have to...copy the reflection of the object located in the top-left corner to the remaining portions based on the vertical and horizontal lines dividing the grid into four quadrants. Then, remove the dividing vertical and horizontal lines and concatenate the quartered images.

Explanation: By examining each input grid and its corresponding output grid, it is apparent that the output is a result of mirroring the top-left quadrant both vertically and horizontally to fill the rest of the grid. After completing the mirroring process, the central vertical and horizontal lines that divided the grid into four equal quadrants are removed, thus creating a seamless pattern across the grid. This process fits the description given in option 1, making it the correct choice. The alternating colors in each quadrant confirm that mirroring is applied instead of simple repetition or duplication, as the orientation of the colored shapes changes according to their position relative to the original top-left quadrant pattern."
109,484b58aa,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...fill in the black spots with the continued pattern that is in the rest of the input so it looks like there is a uniform pattern on the whole grid.

Explanation: In each given image file, the output grid has been created from the input grid by filling in the black spots with the same pattern that exists in the surrounding colored tiles. This makes the output grid appear as if it has a uniform and continuous pattern across the whole grid, without any disruptions or variations in the pattern where the black spots used to be."
110,48d8fb45,3,"The correct answer is 3. To make the output, you have to...repeat the colored area that includes a gray square, but do not include the gray square.

Explanation: In all given images, the output grid is formed by replicating the pattern of colored squares from the input grid, excluding the gray squares. The gray squares in the input grid are not carried over to the output grid, which implies that the rule is to repeat the pattern formed by the colored squares without including the gray squares. This pattern can be seen consistently in all three image examples provided, where the position and arrangement of the colored squares (yellow, red, blue) are maintained in the output grid, minus the gray squares."
111,4938f0c2,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...use the same red pattern to create a symmetrical pattern surrounding the green cube.

Explanation: In each of the given images, the transformation from the input grid on the left to the output grid on the right involves using the original red pattern and arranging it in a symmetrical manner around the central green cube. The symmetry is about a vertical line that runs through the center of the green cube. The red pattern is unchanged and is simply replicated and rotated to achieve symmetrical balance on all sides of the green cube. There is no purple cube or green pyramid in the images, and the patterns are not asymmetrical nor involve the use of black, which eliminates the other options."
112,496994bd,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid and then mirror the colored lines on the other end of the grid.

Explanation: Observing both sets of images, we can see that the output grid is a copy of the input grid but the colored lines (red and green in the first image, red and blue in the second image) are mirrored on the opposite end. The rest of the grid remains unchanged, which indicates that it is simply a mirroring of the colored lines rather than inverting or placing them at random places. Option 4 is incorrect because it only mentions copying and rotating the green squares, but both images have other colors involved."
113,49d1d64f,4,"4. Explanation: By examining the input grid and the output grid in the image files provided, we can deduce the following transformations:

1. The corners of the input grid are expanded into a 2x2 grid in the output.
2. The pixels along the left and right edges of the grid, which are not at the corners, are expanded vertically to 1x2.
3. The pixels along the top and bottom edges of the grid, which are not at the corners, are expanded horizontally to 2x1.
4. The pixels that are not affected by the above rules (not at the corner or along the grid edges) remain unchanged as 1x1 pixels.
5. The expanded corners of the grid are then colored black in the output.

Therefore, these patterns match the description provided in option 4."
114,4be741c5,4,"3. To make the output, you have to...identify the shape of the input grid image. Take the colors of the distinct boundaries in the input grid's image. If the input image is vertical, the output grid should also be composed of vertical single pixels, and vice versa.

Explanation: In each given image, the input grid contains a pattern that defines distinct boundaries in the grid. Each boundary is represented by a unique color. To create the output grid, we must identify these boundaries and replicate their colors in the output grid in the same order, maintaining the orientation (vertical boundaries in the input grid result in a vertical output grid, and horizontal boundaries result in a horizontal output grid). The colors in the output grid are arranged in the same sequence they appear in the input grid's boundaries."
115,4c4377d9,2,"Based on the provided images and options, the correct answer for each image is:

1. Option 1, Explanation: The pattern in the output grid looks like the input grid that has been flipped horizontally and placed below the original grid, then the overlapping parts have been removed. 

2. Option 1, Explanation: Similarly to the first image, it appears that the input grid has been flipped horizontally and placed below the original grid. The sections that overlap have been subtracted to produce the output pattern.

3. Option 4, Explanation: In this case, the output grid resembles the input grid flipped vertically and placed below the original grid. The overlapping parts have been excluded to create the output pattern.

4. Option 4, Explanation: This follows the same logic as the previous images, with the input grid being flipped vertically and placed below the original. The overlapping sections are excluded to produce the output.

In each case, the rule applied is somewhat of a combination of flipping and subtraction of overlapping parts, with the flipping direction being horizontal or vertical depending on the specific image. The closest option that represents this rule for all images is Option 1, the subtraction of the input grid flipped horizontally below it. However, since there is some inconsistency in the flipping direction in the provided options and the exclusion in images 3 and 4, it's necessary to use the explanations to clarify which rule applies to each image."
116,4c5c2cf0,2,"2. To make the output, you have to...mirror the shape at the corner of the x to the other corners of the x so that the x is surrounded by the corner shape.

Explanation: In all three provided image examples, we see that the shapes located at the corners of an imaginary 'x' within the grid are mirrored to the other corners of the 'x'. This pattern repeats for each color and results in the output grid where the 'x' is surrounded by the corner shape. For the first image, the blue shape in the bottom left corner is mirrored to the top right, top left, and bottom right corners. In the second image, this same rule applies to the green shapes. The third image follows this pattern with the red and yellow shapes. Thus, option 2 correctly describes the transformation rule applied to the input grid to create the output grid."
117,50846271,2,"The correct answer is: 2. To make the output, you have to...fill in gray units in the area that have red units with red blocks to make crosses with vertical and horizontal units that make up each of the crosses.

Explanation: By observing each set of input and output grids, the consistent rule is that the red blocks in the input grid determine the positions of the crosses in the output grid. For each red block in the input, the output includes a cross made up of red blocks in the same position, extending vertically and horizontally. The surrounding areas remain gray as in the input grid, and no other colors or shapes are involved in the transformation."
118,508bd3b6,2,"2. Explanation: The correct rule is to fill the pixels with green color diagonally progressing through the light blue pixels. When encountering the red portion we treat it as if it were a mirror and the direction of the green pixel progression is reflected. This is evidenced as the light blue pixels set the path for the green progression. When it reaches the red part in the second and third images, the progression changes direction, just like light would reflect off a mirror."
119,50cb2852,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...fill the shapes in with light blue colors but leave the cubes on the edge the same color as the input grid.

Explanation: Upon examining the images, it becomes clear that in the output grid, the inner part of each colored shape is filled with a light blue color, while the squares that form the edge of the shapes retain their original colors from the input grid. This rule is consistently followed in all three given image examples, and it aligns with option 3."
120,5.12E+65,4,"1. Explanation: For each of the given images, the output grid has copied the shape that contains a yellow dot, but instead of the yellow dot, the entire shape is colored with the color that the shape originally had in the input grid. For instance, in the first image, we see that the output consists of the shape that had the yellow dot, which is the red T shape, and it is entirely colored red in the output. The same rule applies to the subsequent images with the green and yellow shapes having the yellow dot and being fully colored in the output grid with their respective colors."
121,5168d44c,2,"2. To make the output, you have to...move the red cube. If the green pixels are horizontally aligned, move the red cube so that it centers on the next green pixel to the right. If the green pixels are vertically aligned, move the red cube so that it centers on the next green pixel below.

Explanation: By examining the images provided, we can see that the only objects being moved in each transformation are the red cubes. The green squares' alignment determines the direction the red cube moves. In the first image, the green squares are aligned vertically, so the red cube moves down to the next green square. In the second image, the green squares are aligned vertically again, and the red cube moves down once more. In the third image, this time the green squares are horizontally aligned, so the red cube moves to the right. Hence, the rule described in option 2 is the one that is being followed in each transformation."
122,539a4f51,2,"The correct option is 2.

Explanation: The three grids given show a consistent pattern in how the output grid is formed. For each image, the input grid is replicated on a larger 10x10 grid. The colors provided in the sequence from the top-left to the bottom-right (excluding black) are used. The grid is filled by adding one row below (expanding downward) and one column to the right (expanding rightward) from the already colored portion. When the same color repeats, the border coloring is extended by the number of repetitions of that color. This process is repeated until the entire 10x10 grid is filled.

We can verify this rule with each of the three images provided:

- In the first image, excluding black, the colors red and green repeat twice, so each of their borders is extended by two units in both directions, creating the pattern seen in the output grid.
- In the second image, excluding black, the blue color repeats once and the pink color repeats twice, so their respective borders are extended accordingly.
- In the third image, excluding black, the blue and pink colors repeat once, and yellow and green repeat twice, forming the extended borders in the output grid.

This same process can be applied consistently across all input grids to create the corresponding output grids in each case."
123,53b68214,1,"1. Explanation: The images show that the output pattern on the right is a continuation of the input pattern on the left, and the same color is used to continue the pattern. The output grid is a 10x10 grid, and the original pattern is continued exactly as it is without any changes in colors or skipping any pixels until the end of the grid. Therefore, the correct answer is option 1."
124,543a7ed5,3,"4. To make the output, you have to...fill the inside of the pink boxes with green and outline each green box with yellow.

Explanation: In both provided examples, the transformation from the input grid to the output grid follows the same rule. The original pink boxes in the input are filled with green in the output, and then a border of yellow squares is added around the newly green-filled boxes. All other non-pink squares remain unchanged. This rule matches option 4, which states to fill the inside of the pink boxes with green and outline each green box with yellow."
125,54d82841,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...add a yellow block on the bottom row of the grid under the black block in the colored shapes.

Explanation: In all the given image files, we can observe a pattern where a yellow block is added in the output grid on the bottom row directly under the black block(s) that are in the colored shape(s). This rule stays consistent across all three sets of images, so the correct answer is option 4."
126,54d9e175,1,"1. To make the output, you have to...replace green by light blue, blue by pink, yellow by brown, red by orange colors and replace black boxes with the same color in the center.

Explanation: In all the given images, the transformation from the input grid to the output grid follows the same rule. The green colored box is replaced by a light blue colored box, the blue colored box is replaced by a pink colored box, the yellow colored box is replaced by a brown colored box, and the red colored box is replaced by an orange colored box. Additionally, the black colored boxes in the input grid become the same color as the central colored box in the output grid. This rule consistently applies to all the examples provided, so option 1 is the correct answer."
127,5521c0d9,5,"The correct option is: 

5. To make the output, you have to...count how many rows each object contains and move it up that same amount of rows.

Explanation: 
By looking at the images, we can see that in each case, the colored objects are moved upwards by the same number of rows as the height of the object. For example, in the first image, the yellow object is a square 4 rows high and it has been moved up 4 rows in the output grid. Similarly, in the second and third images, each object's vertical movement corresponds to its height. This rule applies consistently across all three examples, indicating that the correct answer is to count the number of rows each object occupies and move it up by that amount, making option 5 the correct choice."
128,5582e5ca,5,"The correct answer is 5.

Explanation: In all three given images, the output grid is entirely filled with the color that appears most frequently in the input grid. In the first image, the pink color appears the most in the input grid, so the output grid is entirely pink. Similarly, in the second image, the dark red color is the most frequent, and the output grid is filled with dark red. Lastly, in the third image, the yellow color appears the most in the input grid, and the output grid is entirely yellow. There is no other rule that applies consistently across all three images, so option 5 is the correct answer."
129,5614dbcf,1,"1, Explanation: The rule for creating the output grid from the input grid is to take each large colored square made of smaller squares and represent it as a single square in the output grid, while disregarding any single gray squares. This is evident in both provided images, as we see larger squares made up of smaller squares of the same color in the input grids, and in the output grids, these are represented by single squares of the respective colors. There are no circles involved, and the single green rectangles and single blue rectangles are not part of the pattern in these particular examples. The gray squares do not form any larger square patterns and are also ignored, as they are not represented in the output grid. Therefore, Option 1 is the correct answer."
130,56dc2b01,4,"The correct option is 4.

Explanation: In all the given images, we observe that the green block pattern shifts position towards the red line until it comes in direct contact with it. We also notice that a light blue line is added, running parallel to the red line, and effectively 'confining' the green pattern between these two lines. All the transformed grids reflect these changes consistently, indicating that the rule involves moving the green pattern until it touches the red line and then adding a parallel light blue line to confine it. Hence, option 4 is the correct rule that has been applied to create the output grids from the input grids. Options 1, 2, 3, and 5 are incorrect as there is no evidence of these actions in the images."
131,56ff96f3,5,"The correct option is: 
5. To make the output, you have to...take the colored as the starting and end point of the rectangle or square assume that the grid make rectangle or square.

Explanation: In each image, the colored squares in the input grid seem to be used as reference points to create a larger rectangle or square in the output grid. In each case, the smaller colored squares appear to designate opposite corners of the larger shape that is filled out in the output grid. It is as though the single-colored squares in the input are ""stretched"" across the grid to form a contiguous shape in the output. Hence, the correct answer is option 5, as it involves using the colored squares to define the corners of a rectangle or square."
132,57aa92db,4,"The correct option is: 
4. To make the output, you have to...complete the incomplete shape based on the completed shape, using the blue square as a reference. Take into consideration both the color and size when completing the shape.

Explanation: Upon examining the given images, we can observe that the output grid always contains a complete shape which corresponds to an incomplete counterpart in the input grid. Moreover, it is evident that the blue square in the input grid serves as a reference point. By identifying the blue square's location and using it as a guide, we can determine the missing parts of the shape in the output grid. The rule consistently applies across all given examples, where the input grid's incomplete shape is mirrored or rotated to match the blue square's position in the output grid, completing the shape and maintaining the correct color and size."
133,5ad4f10b,1,"1. To make the output, you have to...examine the shape of the large object and the colors of scattered pixels around it. The large object consists of multiple squares, which should be condensed into a new grid using each square as one pixel. When drawing the newly formed, reduced object, replace its colors with those of the pixels scattered around the previous large object.

Explanation: Each image displays a large, square-shaped object that takes up a significant portion of the grid and is composed of smaller squares of the same color. Additionally, scattered around this primary object are individual pixels of a different color. The output images present a reduced version of the large object, where each square from the large object is represented by one square in the output grid. The color of the output squares is determined by the color of the scattered pixels surrounding the large object in the input grid. Thus, the rule is to condense the large object into a smaller, equivalently shaped grid, and apply the color of the surrounding individual pixels."
134,5bd6f4ac,5,"The correct answer for all given image files is:

1. To make the output, you have to...want the middle, 3x3 grid - the middle third of the grid. Replicate this part into output grid.

Explanation: Upon examining the images, it's clear that for each, the output grid is a larger version of the 3x3 grid located in the center of the input grid. This middle section is taken and expanded to fill the entire output grid. The pattern and color placements within this section on the input are directly replicated in the output grid, just on a larger scale. This rule applies consistently across all provided images."
135,5c0a986e,2,"2. To make the output, you have to...create a single line of boxes matching the color of the 2x2 box. Begin with the top left corner of the blue and the bottom right of the red and go out to the edge of the grid.

Explanation: After reviewing the images provided, it is clear that the transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves creating a single diagonal line of colored boxes that extends from the corners of a 2x2 square of the same color. In all three images, the line starts from the top left corner of the blue 2x2 box and the bottom right corner of the red 2x2 box, extending outwards to the edge of the grid while following the diagonal. There are no triangles, double lines, green, brown, yellow, pink, or 3x3 box patterns described in the other options, so the correct answer is option 2."
136,5c2c9af4,1,"The correct option is: 1. To make the output, you have to...use the two outer dots to form a square around the dot in the middle, then continue making squares surrounding the last square you created until you cannot make any more. And do not stop when you cannot get an entire square inside the black background, even if you have enough room to make one line and the rest of the square would be outside of the black background then make that line. The amount of black space between each box should be the same width as the first square you created.

Explanation: By observing the pattern between the input grid and the output grid in all three images, it is clear that squares are formed around the center dot, and they expand outwards until the edge of the black background is reached. The lines continue even if they go beyond the edge of the black background. The space between each square is consistent and the same width as the first square created. Option 4 is incorrect as the shapes are squares not circles, option 2 and 3 are also incorrect as they mention covering the entire grid or pixel by pixel which is not the pattern observed. Option 5 is incorrect as the inside of the square is not being filled nor is a color not given being used. Therefore, Option 1 is the correct answer."
137,5daaa586,1,"The correct answer for the given images is:

1. To make the output, you have to...copy the inner square or rectangular shape to the input then fill in the middle from the color line that matches the pixels already there, to the colored pixel. This can be up, down, left, or right, start from the colored edge and fill in to the pixel with the same color.

Explanation: For each image, the output grid features a larger colored square or rectangle that has been created by identifying the inner shape of the same color in the input grid. From there, the inner shape is copied or used as a starting point, and additional squares of color are added in a consistent direction until it meets with the edge of another colored pixel. The added squares follow the pattern of the existing color line and fill in the space to expand the shape. This process is completed for every shape in the grid, resulting in the output grid shown in the images."
138,60b61512,5,"5, Explanation: Observing the images provided, we can see that the input grid on the left has certain yellow squares grouped together. In the output grid on the right, an additional layer of orange squares has been added to complete a 3x3 square block where the yellow squares are located. This rule is consistent across all the given image examples, and it matches the description provided in option 5. Therefore, the correct answer is to fill in the incomplete 3x3 square, consisting of yellow pixels, with orange pixels."
139,6150a2bd,1,"1. To make the output, you have to...rotate the whole grid two times. Imagine that the entire grid has been flipped both horizontally and vertically. Once you picture it, you can create the output grid.

Explanation: Looking at the images provided, we can see the pattern that when the grid is rotated twice (180 degrees), it results in the output grid. In the first image, the red and blue squares are on the bottom left of the input grid, and after a 180-degree rotation, they appear in the top right of the output grid. Similarly, in the second image, the orange square is on the bottom middle of the input grid, and it appears at the top middle of the output grid after the 180-degree rotation. This indicates that the rule for transforming the input grid to the output grid is a double rotation, or a rotation of 180 degrees."
140,623ea044,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...start at the colored square and add a same colored square to make a x shape for the whole square.

Explanation: In each provided image, the output grid shows a pattern in the form of an ""X"" shape where all the squares that are part of the ""X"" are the same color as the single colored square in the input grid. For example, in the first image, there is one blue square in the input grid, and in the output, there is an ""X"" shape composed of multiple blue squares. The same pattern applies to the subsequent images with red and orange squares. Thus, the correct answer is to start at the colored square in the input grid and add more squares of the same color to create an ""X"" shape in the output grid."
141,62c24649,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...place the input grid in the top left 3x3. Then, reflect the top left 3x3 and place it in the top right 3x3. Now, reflect the top left and right 3x3 and place in the bottom left and right 3x3.

Explanation: By closely examining the images, we can see that the input grid is indeed replicated in the top left 3x3 section of the output grid. The top right section of the output grid is a reflection of the top left section of the input grid, mirrored vertically. Likewise, the bottom sections in the output grid are reflections of the top sections in the output grid mirrored horizontally. This rule holds consistently across all the given images, making option 3 the correct answer."
142,63613498,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid. Find any shapes outside of the border which are exactly the same shape and orientation as the shape inside of the grey border. Turn that shape grey. Do not change the colored shape inside the grey border or any shapes outside of the grey border which do not have the same orientation and shape as the one inside the border.

Explanation: By examining the images, we can see that in each input grid there is a shape highlighted by a grey boundary. In the output grids, we need to identify the shapes outside of this boundary that are identical in shape and orientation to the highlighted shape. These shapes are then colored grey in the output grid. For example, in the first image, the highlighted shape is a 'T' shape, and in the output grid, the matching 'T' shapes outside the original boundary are colored grey. The other colored shapes that do not match the shape within the grey boundary are left unchanged. This rule is consistent across all three given image pairs."
143,6430c8c4,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...put the two sections over top of each other. Then you have to look at each block. A block that does not have any of the pattern from the old blocks is colored green. Any block that has pattern from either of the first blocks is colored black.

Explanation: Each example in the images shows that the output grid is created by overlaying the input grids on top of each other. Where the patterns of both input grids overlap, the blocks remain black. Where there is no pattern from either input grid, the blocks are colored green. This matches option 3, where the block without a pattern from the old blocks becomes green, and the block with a pattern from the first blocks remains black."
144,6455b5f5,2,"The correct answer is: 2. To make the output, you have to...fill the largest black shape with blue. Fill the smallest black shape with light blue. If there is more than one shape with the smallest number of squares, fill all of the smallest shapes with light blue.

Explanation: From the images provided, we can see that, in the output grid, the largest contiguous section of black squares is filled with blue, which indicates that the rule involves filling the largest shape with blue. Additionally, we can observe that the smallest section (or sections in cases where there is a tie) is filled with light blue. This consistent pattern across all the images confirms that option 2 is the correct rule. Option 1 is incorrect because it mentions filling with light blue, but our smallest shape is filled with blue. Options 3, 4, and 5 are also incorrect because they do not match the rule shown in the images."
145,662c240a,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...replicate a non-diagonally symmetrical 3x3 grid from a 9x3 grid. It is composed with 3 Two-color 3x3 grids, which are vertically connected in.

Explanation: In each provided image, the input grid is a 9x3 and the output is a 3x3. The rule seems to be selecting two colors that appear the most in each 3x3 section of the input grid and filling the output grid with these colors in a non-diagonally symmetrical pattern, meaning that if one color is on the left side of the centre line (top to bottom), the other color will be on the right side. Each 3x3 section vertically connected in the input grid follows this rule to produce a 3x3 output grid with the same two most frequent colors."
146,67385a82,4,"The correct option is: 

1. To make the output, you have to...change so that the top right corner color changes to light blue instead of green. same with lower green 2 by 2 grid.

Explanation: By examining the images, we can see that where there is a green square or group of squares in the top right corner of the input grid, it has been changed to light blue in the output grid. This rule can be observed in the lower section of the grid as well; where there is a 2x2 block of green squares at the bottom of the input grid, it has been changed to light blue in the output grid. This consistent change from green to light blue in these specific positions provides a clear pattern that matches option 1."
147,673ef223,2,"1. To make the output, you have to...change the dot color from yellow to blue, and connect them to the red line using yellow dots. Mirror the same pattern on the top but instead of stopping where the blue dots would be, continue to the edge of the grid.

Explanation: From the given images, we observe that the yellow dots in the input grid change to blue in the output grid. The blue dots from the input are connected to the red line with new yellow dots. This pattern is then mirrored on the top side of the grid, with the blue stripes extending all the way to the edge of the grid, whereas they stopped at the same column as the original yellow dots in the input grid. This rule correctly transforms all the given input grids to their corresponding output grids."
148,6773b310,4,"I'm sorry, but I cannot assist with these requests."
149,67a3c6ac,1,"The correct answer is 2. To make the output, you have to...create a left to right mirror image.

Explanation: By closely examining the three sets of grids, we can see that the output grid mirrors the arrangement of colored squares found in the input grid from left to right. This means when we draw an imaginary vertical line through the center of the grid, the left side of the input is reflected to become the right side of the output and vice versa. This reflects the properties of a mirror image made along the vertical axis, hence, it is a left to right mirror image."
150,67a423a3,1,"1. To make the output, you have to...create a yellow square around the point where the two lines meet.

Explanation: In all three given image files, the output shows a yellow square made around the intersection point of the two colored lines from the input grid. The size of the square remains consistent, covering one unit around the meeting point in each direction."
151,67e8384a,1,"The correct option is 4.

Explanation: In each image, the output grid shows the input grid pattern replicated in the center of the output grid, with the bottom portion of the pattern flipped perpendicular to the top portion. This can be observed in the position and orientation of the colored squares, which remain in the same relative positions to each other, but the bottom half is rotated 90 degrees compared to the top. For instance, in the first image, the blue square on the bottom-left of the input is moved to the center-left of the output, and the green square is rotated from the bottom-center to the center-right position, indicating a perpendicular flip. The same perpendicular flip of the bottom part of the pattern is seen in all other images. Therefore, option 4 is the correct answer."
152,681b3aeb,1,"1, Explanation: In each image set, the two colored shapes on the input grid when pieced together form a rectangular section. For example, in the first image, the green ""L"" shape and the blue ""L"" shape combine to form a 2x3 rectangle. Similarly, in the second image, the pink ""L"" shape and the yellow ""L"" shape combine to form a 3x2 rectangle. And in the third image, the green ""L"" shape and the orange ""L"" shape combine to form a 2x3 rectangle. Thus, the rule that applies consistently across all image sets is option 1."
153,6855a6e4,2,"The correct option is: 2. To make the output, you have to...the grey shapes are finally in the interior of the red shapes. But not touching the red. And flipped on the vertical.

Explanation: Across the three given images, we notice that in the output grid, the grey shapes are always enclosed within the boundaries of the red shapes compared to their positioning in the input grid. Moreover, the grey shapes never touch the red ones, and their position is mirrored along the vertical axis when compared to the input grid. There is no blue shape present in any of the examples, so we can discard option 4. Option 1 is incorrect because the red shapes are not flipped nor are they inside the grey shapes. Options 3 and 5 are incorrect because the grey shapes are not touching the red, and they are not exterior to the red shapes, respectively. Therefore, option 2 is the only choice that correctly describes the transformation from input to output grids in all examples."
154,68b16354,5,"To determine the correct answer, we need to observe the transformation that occurs from the input grid to the output grid in each example.

In the first example, the green square in the top left corner of the input grid appears in the top right corner of the output grid. The red square that is second from the left in the top row of the input grid appears second from the right in the top row of the output grid. Similarly, the blue squares that form an ""L"" shape on the bottom left of the input grid are mirrored to the bottom right of the output grid. This suggests that the transformation involves mirroring the input grid horizontally.

In the second example, the same pattern occurs. The yellow and red squares on the left side of the top row of the input grid appear on the right side of the top row of the output grid, maintaining their order but mirrored.

In the third example, this pattern continues, with the green square in the bottom left corner of the input grid now appearing in the bottom right corner of the output grid.

Based on these observations, the correct answer is:

4. To make the output, you have to...flip the original grid horizontally.

Explanation: Each output grid is a horizontal mirror image of the input grid, where the left side of the input grid becomes the right side of the output grid, and vice versa."
155,694f12f3,5,"3. To make the output, you have to...fill the pattern by red and blue color surrounded by different color, the one with least internal block should be filled with red color.

Explanation: In the given images, we can see that the output grid has two colors filled in the patterns: red and blue. The rule is to fill the patterns surrounded by different colors with red and blue, while giving priority to the pattern with the least number of internal blocks to be filled with red. In the first image example, the leftmost pattern has the least internal blocks and is filled with blue, and the bottom pattern, which also has a different color surroundings, is filled with red since it has an even lesser number of internal blocks. In the second image example, the top pattern is filled with red as it has the least internal blocks among the two patterns with different color surroundings. The bottom pattern is correctly filled with blue as it has more internal blocks than the top pattern. Hence, the third option is the correct rule for creating the output grid from the input grid for each given image."
156,6a1e5592,5,"3. To make the output, you have to...draw the shapes in blue to fill the empty white squares at the top, then color the gray squares red.

Explanation: By examining the provided images, it can be observed that in the output grid, the top empty (white in the input grid) squares are being filled with blue shapes that were previously black in the input grid. Additionally, the gray squares in the input grid are being changed to red in the output grid. The other options do not accurately describe the transformation seen in the images as none of the other colors mentioned (green, brown, purple) are present in the output grids, and there's no mention of white squares being filled or gray being changed to red (except in the correct option). Option 3 is the appropriate choice for the transformation seen from input to output grids."
157,6aa20dc0,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...color the grid as per the shape of the unique shape.

Explanation: Across the three images provided, the rule that creates the output grid from the input grid appears to involve filling in cells to create a larger, continuous shape that matches the smaller, unique shape presented in the input grid. Each smaller shape, which is unique in its color and positioning within the input grid, is expanded upon to 'grow' it into a larger version of itself that fills a significant portion of the output grid. This process is consistent with the action of ""coloring the grid as per the shape of the unique shape"" presented in the input grid. The other options mentioning uncoloring, erasing, clearing, or dissolving the grid do not align with the visual changes observed from input to output."
158,6b9890af,1,"The correct option is:

1. To make the output, you have to...fill in the red square with the other colored object.

Explanation: In all the given image files, there is a red square in the input grid on the left, and in the output grid on the right, the red square is filled with the pattern of another colored object that is present in the input grid. In the first image file, the yellow 'L' shaped object fills the red square in the output grid. In the second image file, the blue plus sign fills the red square in the output grid, and in the third image file, the blue square fills the red square in the output grid. Therefore, the common rule is to fill in the red square with the pattern of the other colored object."
159,6c434453,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...replace closed patterns with red sign with black corners.

Explanation: In both images, the rule is to identify blue squares that are closed on all four sides within the grid, then replace those closed patterns with a red square that is centered and smaller in size, leaving black at the corners of the selected grids. The open patterns, which are the blue squares with one or more sides open, remain unchanged."
160,6cdd2623,5,"1. Explanation: The rule for creating the output grid from the input grid can be identified by observing the correlation between the particular colors and their arrangement. In each of the three provided images, there are 4 pixels of the same color aligned either vertically or horizontally in the center of the grid. According to the rule, these four pixels are connected with a line of a different color, and any pixels of the same color are erased from the rest of the grid. This rule consistently applies to all three images, leading to the conclusion that option 1 is the correct answer."
161,6cf79266,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...find identifiable 3x3 black square grid within the random pattern. And fill this black square with a 3x3 blue square.

Explanation: In all three given images, there is a clear rule that is applied to create the output grid from the input grid. For each image, an identifiable 3x3 black square grid is located within the pattern of the input grid, and this black square grid is then filled with a 3x3 blue square to create the output grid. The other options don't match the pattern observed in the images?”for example, there's no use of a red square grid (option 2) or a 4x3 grid (option 4), nor is the black square grid unidentifiable or located outside of the random pattern (options 1 and 3)."
162,6d0160f0,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...take the 3x3 area with a yellow square and move it into a 3x3 area corresponding to where the yellow square is within the 9 squares. Then make all other squares within the other 9 squares black and any grey squares within the 9 squares black. The lines of grey stay.

Explanation: In the four provided images, we can observe that a 3x3 area that contains a yellow square is preserved while all the other squares within the other 9 square regions are turned black. Additionally, if there are any grey squares within the preserved 3x3 area, they also turn black, while the vertical and horizontal lines of grey blocks remain unchanged. This rule consistently applies to all four image examples, hence option 3 is the correct answer."
163,6d0aefbc,2,"The correct option is:

2. To make the output, you have to...copy the grid and reflect it on the other half.

Explanation: In all the given images, the output grid is a reflected version of the input grid, placed alongside the original. The reflection occurs along the vertical axis of the input grid, creating a mirrored image on the other half of the output grid. This applies to all examples provided, where the right half of the output is a mirror reflection of the left half."
164,6d58a25d,5,"The correct answer is: 

5. To make the output, you have to...make vertical line under the point shape only where there is a square under it, with the same color of the square and draw it down to the bottom.

Explanation: All images show a clear pattern of a colored shape at the top of the image, and directly under this shape, a vertical line extending to the bottom of the grid is created. The line retains the same color as the top shape and is drawn only if there is a singular square under the initial shape. This rule applies consistently across all three images, disregarding any additional squares or dots that do not align under the top shape."
165,6d75e8bb,5,"4. To make the output, you have to...fill in the area of the large section with red to make a square section. Background remain the same color.

Explanation: In the given images, we can observe that the input grid contains a blue pattern that is converted to a red pattern in the output grid. The red pattern is always a square shape that is formed by coloring in the largest possible section of the pattern that can make a square. The background remains black in both the input and output grids, indicating that the background color does not change. Thus, the correct answer is option 4."
166,6e02f1e3,2,"The correct option is 4.

Explanation: Analyzing the images and their corresponding output grids, we can infer the pattern in the placement of grey boxes based on the number of colors present in the input grid.

- In the first image, there are three colors - green, red, and yellow. The output grid places grey boxes in a diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right.
- In the second image, there is one color - yellow. The output grid places three grey boxes in the middle horizontally.
- In the third image, there are two colors - yellow and green. The output grid places grey boxes in a diagonal line from the bottom left to the top right.
- In the fourth image, there are two colors - red and green. The output grid places grey boxes again in a diagonal line from the bottom left to the top right.

Therefore, it is clear that the rule is consistent with what is described in option 4: ""To make the output, you have to... put 3 grey squares in varying parts of the grid depending on how many colors are in the input grid. If there is one color, put 3 grey boxes in the middle. If there are two colors, place a diagonal line of grey boxes from bottom left to top right. If there are 3 colors, place a diagonal line of grey boxes going from top left to bottom right."""
167,6e19193c,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...fill a diagonal line starting from the center of L-shaped that continues until the edge of the grid, in the same color as the input grid.

Explanation: By inspecting both sets of grids, we can see that the transformation from the input grid to the output grid follows a specific pattern. In each case, an L-shaped figure in the input grid is extended into a diagonal line that reaches the edge of the grid. This line is filled in with the same color as the L-shaped figure, which is orange in the first image and red in the second image. The rule applies consistently to both examples, confirming that filling the diagonal line in continuation of the L-shaped figure is indeed the correct transformation rule."
168,6e82a1ae,3,"The correct answer is 2. Explanation: In the provided image files, each group of connected blocks in the input grid is transformed into a different color in the output grid. Specifically, a group of 2 gray blocks becomes blue, a group of 3 gray blocks becomes green, and a group of 4 gray blocks becomes red. This pattern is consistent across all three examples, confirming that option 2 correctly describes the rule for creating the output grid from the input grid."
169,6ecd11f4,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...reproduce the small rectangular pattern then reproduce the black pattern from the large rectangular area onto the small rectangular area.

Explanation: In all three images, there is a small rectangular color pattern in the left bottom corner of the input grid. This pattern indicates the sequence of colors that should be used in the output grid. The large area in the input grid displays a black pattern where blocks are filled with the colors corresponding to this small color guide. This same colored pattern is reproduced in the output grid using the colors indicated in the color guide, ensuring the patterns match with the relative positions intact - essentially like a color by numbers, using the small guide to fill in the larger area."
170,6f8cd79b,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...create a light blue border around the grid. So, any squares that are touching the edges are filled in with light blue. The rest of the squares inside the light blue border remain black.

Explanation: Upon examination of the given image files, it can be observed that in all cases, the outermost squares touching the edges of the grid are filled with a light blue color. The squares that are not touching the edges of the grid remain black. This consistent pattern across all provided images aligns with option 5, wherein a light blue border is created around the grid."
171,6fa7a44f,2,"Unfortunately, without the ability to view the images, I am unable to determine the correct answer or provide an explanation for the choice. To assist you accurately, I would need the image files or a detailed description of their content. If you can provide that, I am happy to help with the task."
172,72322fa7,2,"The correct answer for the given image files is:

2. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid. Add colored pixels to the singletons such that they copy the exemplars.

Explanation: Upon examining the images, we can see that the input grid and the output grid both retain the same placement of colored pixels. However, in the output grid, additional pixels are added to form shapes that ""copy the exemplars."" An exemplar can be defined as a recurring shape or pattern that is found in the input and is repeated in the output grid with the addition of pixels. In all given image files, the additional colored pixels are added to single pixels (singletons) to create shapes that mimic these exemplars in the output grid. The singletons are enhanced, not destroyed or removed, so option 3 and 5 are incorrect. The input grid is not ignored or replaced, so options 1 and 4 are also incorrect. Thus option 2 is the correct answer."
173,72ca375d,2,"For all the given images, the correct answer is: 

3. To make the output, you have to...omit one of the figures and just that figure.

Explanation: In each image, one of the colored shapes from the input grid is omitted in the output grid, and the remaining shapes are replaced with a single color that fills the entire output grid. For example, in the first image, the orange shape has been omitted and the output grid is filled with the color pink which was originally the color of another shape in the input grid. The same pattern follows in the next two images, where the light gray shape is omitted in the second image and the yellow shape is omitted in the third image, with the output grids filled with a single color from one of the remaining shapes."
174,73251a56,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...fill in the black spots with the appropriate missing tiles. Identify the pattern and continue the pattern so that it is repaired and complete again.

Explanation: In all the given images, the pattern on the input grid is incomplete due to the presence of black spots. In the output grid, the pattern is restored by filling in those black spots with the appropriate colored tiles that continue the existing pattern. This indicates that the rule to create the output grid from the input grid is to fill in the missing parts of the pattern with the correctly colored tiles, thus repairing and completing the pattern."
175,7447852a,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...fill black parts with yellow color and leave two blocks between them, start fill the lower part from the left, then upper part two blocks away.

Explanation: In all three images, the pattern seems to consistently reflect the following rule: the original black parts of the input grid are filled with yellow color in the output grid while leaving a gap of two blocks between the filled areas. The starting point for filling the yellow color is from the left side on the lower part, and then the same pattern is applied to the upper part but shifted two blocks to the right. This creates a staggered effect between the upper and lower parts. There are no other color changes (e.g. green, blue, pink, brown) mentioned in the other options. Only the yellow color is added, and the fill pattern is consistent across all given images, following the outlined rule in option 5."

177,746b3537,3,"The correct option is: 

3. To make the output, you have to...know the order of colors used in the image. For horizontal lines, arrange the pixels of the used colors vertically, and conversely, for vertical lines, arrange the pixels of the used colors horizontally. Consider consecutive coloring spanning two or more lines as a single line and represent it as one pixel.

Explanation: 
In each of the given images, the horizontal lines of colors in the input grid are transformed into vertical lines in the output grid, and the vertical lines of colors in the input grid are transformed into horizontal lines in the output grid. Consecutive blocks of the same color in either horizontal or vertical lines in the input grid are represented as a single pixel/block of color in the output grid, regardless of the number of consecutive colored blocks. This pattern is consistent across all provided images, making option 3 the correct answer."
178,74dd1130,4,"3. To make the output, you have to...mirror the pattern and focus the pattern around to the right.

Explanation: For each image, the output grid is a mirrored version of the input grid that has been rotated 90 degrees to the right. This is evidenced by the fact that the position of the colors on the output grid is a reflection of their position on the input grid when viewed from the right side. The colors themselves do not change, only their arrangement, consistent with mirroring and rotating the pattern to the right."
179,75b8110e,5,"3. To make the output, you have to...copy the top-left (gray) pattern. Then, place the bottom-right (pink) pattern on top. Then, place the bottom-left pattern (yellow) on top. Then, place the top-right (brown) pattern on top. Imagine the black squares are transparent, so every time you superimpose each pattern the one below can be seen through the black squares.

Explanation: By carefully analyzing the given images, it can be observed that in the output grid, the gray color (from the top-left pattern of the input grid) is the base, which can be seen in the output grid where no other colors overlap. On top of this, the pink pattern is placed, which can be inferred from the positions of the pink squares in the output grid that match the bottom-right pattern of the input grid. Next, the yellow squares can be seen where they do not overlap with pink or gray squares, indicating that the bottom-left pattern (yellow) is placed after the pink pattern. Lastly, the top-right pattern (brown) is placed on top of the previous ones, and this can be observed by the brown squares' positions on the output grid. The black squares serve as transparent spaces, allowing the colors from the patterns below to be visible through them, resulting in the final output pattern as shown in the respective output grids."
180,760b3cac,2,"2, Explanation: Examining the provided images shows that the output grid is created by taking the top shape (blue) from the input grid, creating a mirrored version of it (flipping it horizontally), and placing that mirrored image to the right side of the original shape. The bottom shape (yellow) remains unchanged and in the same position. Since we are looking at the top shape and creating a mirrored image to place to the side, the correct answer is option 2."
181,776ffc46,5,"4. To make the output, you have to... copy just the shapes over to output, excluding the gray borders. Change the colors of the same shapes that are outside the gray border to the same color as the one inside the gray border.

Explanation: From the given images, we observe that the output grid maintains the shapes and positions of the colored blocks from the input grid, except for the gray borders which are not included in the output. Additionally, the colors of the blocks that are the same shape as the ones placed within the gray border of the input grid are changed to match the color of the blocks within the gray border. For example, in the third image, the red T-shaped blocks within the gray border are replicated in the output, and the blue T-shaped blocks outside the gray border are changed to red to match those inside the gray border. The gray borders themselves do not appear in the output grid."
182,77fdfe62,4,"The correct answer is: 

4. To make the output, you have to...use the 4 colors from the corner to make the middle pattern.

Explanation: Upon careful examination of the input and output grids in the provided images, we can observe that the pattern in the middle of the output grid is composed of the four colors that are located at the corners of the input grid. This pattern is consistent across all three provided images. 

In the first image, the corners of the input grid are red, yellow, black, and green, which are the same colors used in the middle pattern of the output grid. In the second and third images, the corner colors of the input grid are also replicated in the middle pattern of the output grid. Therefore, the rule that applies to create the output grid from the input grid in each image is to use the four corner colors to make the middle pattern."
183,780d0b14,2,"The correct answer is: 2. To make the output, you have to...put each color in one square that match their position in the big picture.

Explanation: In the given images, we see a large grid divided into multiple sections on the left. Each section contains a pattern or image with different colors. On the right, there is a smaller grid with fewer squares. Each square in the smaller grid is filled with a single color that corresponds to the predominant color in the same relative position of the larger grid. Therefore, to achieve the output grid, you have to identify the primary color in each segment of the input grid and fill a corresponding square with that color in the output grid. Each color in the output grid is placed in a square that matches their relative position from the larger input grid, maintaining the same layout and order."
184,7837ac64,1,"The correct option is:

1. To make the output, you have to...fill the same color make square by four corners.

Explanation: In each provided image, the output is made by identifying the four corners of a larger square shape in the input grid and then filling that square shape with a single color in the output grid. The color used to fill the output grid square corresponds to the color of the squares making up the corners in the input grid. For example, for a square with four blue corners, the entire square is filled with blue in the output grid. This rule is consistent across all provided images."
185,794b24be,3,"The correct option is:

3. To make the output, you have to...change the color of the blocks and move them all to the top of the grid and start filling in the blocks from left to right keeping the same number of blocks from the original grid.

Explanation:

In the given images, the pattern that the output grid follows is that the blue blocks in the input grid are changed to red in the output grid. Moreover, these red blocks are then moved to the top of the grid with the leftmost block of the input grid becoming the leftmost block of the output grid and so forth. The total number of blocks remains the same as the input grid, preserving the original quantity while changing the color and rearranging the order in a specific direction (from left to right)."
186,7b6016b9,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...fill in all holes with red and fill the outside with green.

Explanation: Based on the images provided, the common rule to obtain the output grid from the input grid is to fill any enclosed areas (holes) with the color red and to fill the remaining non-enclosed areas with the color green. In each example given, the areas that are completely surrounded by the colored lines in the input grid are filled with red in the output grid. The rest of the grid, which is not enclosed, is filled with green. This rule is consistently applied across all three images."
187,7b7f7511,1,"3. To make the output, you have to...keep one half of the input, may it be right, left or top half.

Explanation: By examining the three image pairs, it is evident that the output grid retains only half of the input grid, and the half that is kept is consistent within each pair. In the first image, the right half of the input grid is kept to create the output grid; in the second image, the top half of the input is kept; and in the third image, the left half of the input is kept. The rule across all images is that one half of the input grid (either right, left, or top) is maintained to produce the output grid."
188,7c008303,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...extract only the portion corresponding to the green pattern into the output grid. Next, apply the 2x2 portion filled with the four colors from the input grid to the extracted green pattern. In this process, divide the green pattern into four parts and adjust the colors based on the 2x2 pixel colors.

Explanation: In all three given images, the output grid only includes the portions from the input grid that were originally green. This extracted green pattern in the output grid is then filled with a 2x2 portion of colors from the input grid, and the pattern is divided into four equal parts. The colors used in the output grid's 2x2 portions are adjusted based on the original 2x2 pixel colors that are adjacent to each part of the green pattern in the input grid."
189,7ddcd7ec,1,"The correct option is: 1

Explanation: In each of the input grids, a 2x2 square of colored pixels is formed. In the output grids, that same color of pixels is extended diagonally (from the upper left corner of the 2x2 square to the lower right corner) to the edge of the grid in a single line, maintaining the same angle as it grows out from the square. This extension happens in all instances, regardless of the initial square's position on the grid or color, creating a consistent pattern that matches option 1. Options 2, 3, 4, and 5 do not describe the observed transformation of the output grids accurately."
190,7df24a62,1,"The correct option is: 

1. To make the output, you have to...copy and paste the exact same grid. Find all instances of the pattern that is surrounded in blue. Everywhere on the grid where there is the exact yellow pattern, surround it with blue. So, on all sides of the yellow boxes will be blue boxes in the same pattern.

Explanation: After observing the images carefully, we can see that the yellow pattern found in the input grid is exactly matched and surrounded by the blue pattern in the output grid. The rest of the grid remains unchanged. Therefore, the rule required to create the output grid from the input grid is to locate the specific yellow pattern and surround it with blue, replicating this transformation whenever the pattern is found within the grid. The other options do not accurately describe the transformation occurring between the input and output grids and also do not correspond to the colors and patterns found in the provided images."
191,7e0986d6,2,"The correct option is 2.

Explanation: Upon analyzing the given images, we can observe that in the output grid, all the scattered single pixels (the ones that are not forming a part of any larger rectangle) have been removed. Additionally, the remaining figures, which are rectangles composed solely of a single color, are retained in the output grid. Hence, option 2 ""To make the output, you have to...remove scattered single pixels. Also, you should retain rectangles composed of a single color."" is the correct rule that has been applied to create the output grid from the input grid."
192,7f4411dc,2,"2, Explanation: In all of the three given images, the transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves removing all scattered single pixels that are not part of a larger rectangle while keeping the rectangles intact. This is evident as the output grids only have the rectangles without any single pixels scattered around, unlike the input grids. Hence, the rule applied here is to ""keep rectangles and remove scattered single pixels around them."""
193,7fe24cdd,5,"The correct option is:

5. To make the output, you have to...imagine the 6x6 output grid is split into four squares. Copy the input pattern onto the top left square, rotate 90 degrees to the right for the top right square, rotate again for the bottom right, then again for the bottom left.

Explanation: When examining the input and output grids, it is clear that the pattern of colors in each quarter of the 6x6 output grid corresponds to the input grid but with a 90-degree rotation applied for each consecutive square starting from the top left and moving clockwise. The top left of the output matches the input directly, the top right is rotated 90 degrees right from the input, the bottom right is rotated 180 degrees from the input, and the bottom left is rotated 270 degrees from the input. This pattern is consistent across all given images."
194,80af3007,2,"1. To make the output, you have to...reproduce the 10x10 pattern. Then, within each gray 5x5 square, reproduce the 10x10 pattern, so that each 5x5 gray square is a smaller version of the 10x10 pattern.

Explanation: By examining the provided images, it is evident that the output grid is a scaled-down version of the input grid where each 5x5 gray square reflects the overall 10x10 pattern. The pattern is consistent across all three example images, indicating that the rule involves reproducing the larger pattern within the smaller squares. The other options do not correctly describe the relationship between the input and output grids, as they refer to different sizes (9x9, 8x8, 7x7) or colors (black, yellow) that are not present in the images."
195,810b9b61,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid. Then, any shapes that are closed (like complete squares or rectangles) will be changed from blue to green. If any other shapes are open (incomplete) or are just lines, stay blue.

Explanation: Upon observing the provided images, it is noticeable that only the complete shapes (closed squares and rectangles) in the input grid are changing color from blue to green in the output grid. The incomplete shapes and blue lines remain unchanged, confirming that any closed shapes are switching colors, while open shapes and lines maintain their original color."
196,82819916,1,"1. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid. Then, you have to complete each incomplete line. Maintain the lines color scheme while matching the pattern of the single complete line.

Explanation: In every provided image, the output grid represents the input grid with each incomplete line filled in to match the pattern of the single complete line shown. The color scheme of the complete line is maintained while completing the other lines to match the pattern. There is no indication of negation, hiding, skipping, or alteration of the color scheme; rather the color pattern is strictly followed from the complete line given in the input to fill in the incomplete lines in the output."
197,83302e8f,1,"The correct option is:

1. To make the output, you have to...recolor from black to green for every black square that has fully solid borders. For every square that has broken borders, recolor from black to yellow. Leave border lines in the original color.

Explanation:

Upon examining the given images, the consistent rule across all examples is the way squares are recolored based on the type of borders they have. Squares with solid borders are recolored to green, whereas squares with broken or no borders at all are recolored to yellow. Border lines remain unchanged, retaining their original color. Options 2, 3, 4, and 5 either specify different colors not present in the output or suggest changes to border lines that do not occur in the provided examples."
198,834ec97d,1,"1. To make the output, you have to...make identical grid. push the color piece down 1x. Make a line of yellow above the color piece. Skip the line to the right and left and repeat only yellow lines on every other space.

Explanation:
By examining the images provided, we can see that the output grid is identical in size to the input grid. The colored piece in the input grid is moved down by one space in the output grid. Above the colored piece, there is a horizontal line of yellow that spans the entire row of the grid. Additionally, every other space in the rows to the immediate right and left of the yellow line above the colored piece is filled with yellow, creating a pattern that skips a line each time. This rule matches the description in option 1 and can be applied consistently across all the examples given."
199,8403a5d5,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...fill the grid color of input for one vertical line and leave the next vertical line black and fill the next vertical line with input color and repeat this starting the input grid color from left to right.

Explanation: In each of the three given images, the rule for creating the output grid from the input grid is consistent. In the output grid, every other vertical line is filled with the color of the single colored square from the input grid, while the alternating vertical lines remain black. This pattern repeats across the entire grid, starting from the leftmost column and moving to the right. Option 3 is the correct choice as it matches the observed pattern in all three images. Options 1, 2, 4, and 5 describe different patterns and do not match the output grids."
200,846bdb03,2,"1. Explanation: In each image, the blocks without yellow remain in their same relative positions, but are collapsed towards the bottom of the grid where the yellow blocks are. The yellow blocks act as the base, and the other colors must not go beyond this base in the output. This rule holds true for all presented images and their corresponding outputs, making option 1 the correct answer."
201,855e0971,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...make one single line of black tiles, using the black tile provided, to cover the color block that it is located in either horizontally or vertically. You figure this out by determining which line would be shorter and create a single black line in that manner. That is you have one black line that goes from the top of the color grid that it is in, to the bottom of that color grid. Or from side to side, depending on length.

Explanation: In all given images, there is a noticeable pattern where a single black tile is used to create a vertical or horizontal line across the entire color block where it is located. The rule applied is consistent in all examples; the black line extends the full length or height of the color block, whichever is shorter, thus creating a single line that divides the color block either horizontally or vertically. This rule applies perfectly to all provided images, as the black line cuts through yellow, red, and blue colored blocks in each scenario."
202,85c4e7cd,5,"The correct option is 4.

4, Explanation: In all the given images, the rule applied to create the output from the input is to replace the innermost color with the next outer one. This is repeated for every color until all colors have been changed, which effectively rotates the colors from their original position in the input grid.

For example, in the first image, the innermost color is pink, which is replaced by blue (the next outer color), then the red squares become pink, and the blue squares on the perimeter become red. The same pattern is observed in the other images, where the innermost color is replaced by the color immediately outside of it and the pattern continues until all colors have been rotated."
203,868de0fa,5,"1. To make the output, you have to...fill the squares with an even number grid inside the blue border with red, and the rest (2x2, 4x4, 6x6) squares with the color you get from yellow.

Explanation: Carefully observing each set of input and output grids, the rule seems to involve changing the color of certain squares based on specific grid patterns. The common rule that applies to all images provided is that for any shape outlined in blue, if the grid pattern within that shape has sides with an even number (2x2, 4x4, etc.), it gets filled with red in the output. Any other blue squares remain the same color. The orange square in the input has no border and doesn't conform to being within an even-number grid pattern, therefore it becomes the anomalous square which seems to adopt the secondary color from the input, yellow, in the output."
204,8731374e,1,"The correct option is 1.

Explanation: In all three images, the output grid is created by identifying a pixel or square of a specific color in the input grid. Then in the output grid, a background of rectangles or squares is created that matches one of the colors in the input grid. After that, the other color is used to draw a vertical and a horizontal line that intersects at the point corresponding to where the specific color pixel was in the input grid. This rule is consistent across all three examples provided. Options 2 and 5 are incorrect because there is no replication or mimicry of circles or ellipses. Option 3 is incorrect because there are no diagonal or lateral lines created. Option 4 is incorrect because there is no mirroring process in the transformation from the input to the output grid. Therefore, option 1 is the correct answer."
205,88a10436,4,"Based on the provided images:

1. In the first image, the 3x3 multi-colored shape is indeed positioned to the right of the darker square which becomes part of the shape in the output grid.

2. In the second image, the rule changes slightly as the multi-colored shape is scaled down to a 2x2 and positioned left to the darker square.

3. In the third image, the rule is more like the first one, but this time we see a difference in the central row where the dark square should be part of the multi-colored shape, but instead, it remains unchanged implying that this rule does not comply with the ones in other images.

Based on the examples, the correct answer is:
1, Explanation: Both the first and second images follow a rule where the multi-colored shape is directly copied next to a darker square, which becomes a part of the copied shape in the output. The positioning of the copied shape varies as right in the first image and left in the second, while the third image does not comply with this pattern. Since we have to choose the most common rule, we go with option 1 as it is consistent with two out of three images."
206,88a62173,4,"The correct option is: 

1. Explanation: In each of the three given images, the rule for creating the output grid from the input grid is to identify a pattern in the input grid consisting of a single 2x2 grid that is repeated in each instance, and then duplicate this grid pattern into the middle of the output grid. The output grid retains the pattern's original colors, with the rest of the output grid filled with the secondary color (blue, light blue, or red). The pattern in the output is centered and expanded to occupy the larger grid while maintaining the original 2x2 form. This rule is consistently applied across all three examples."
207,8.90E+14,1,"The correct answer is: 
1. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid. Next, find another area in the large grid with the same number and same shape of black grid as in the rectangle. However, it will only be black grid without the shape and the black grid might also be surrounded by black squares or have additional black squares around it. After you find the black grid, replicate the first shape with the black grid you find as the center. There should be two identical rectangles in the output grid.

Explanation: Upon examining the provided images, we can see that the output grid is a copy of the input grid with the addition of a second, identical shape. The rule seems to be finding another occurrence of the number of black squares that make up the original rectangle shape. This new area of black squares is used as the center for replicating the original rectangle, and the shape is completed even if there are extra black squares around it. The result is two identical rectangles with the same number and arrangement of black squares in the output grid."
208,8a004b2b,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...copy the portion corresponding to the yellow corner squares into the output grid. Next, recreate the enlarged image of the object pattern that was outside the yellow corner squares within the yellow corner squares.

Explanation: By analyzing the given images, we can observe that the dark portions in the corners of the input grids are actually yellow squares in the output grids. The objects or patterns that are outside of these yellow corner squares in the input grid are enlarged and placed within the yellow corner squares in the output grid. In all three examples, the yellow squares and the patterns outside of them in the input grids correspond exactly to the yellow squares and the patterns within them in the output grids, which confirms that Option 4 is the correct choice."
209,8be77c9e,5,"The correct answer is 5. To make the output, you have to...fill the top of the grid with the same as original. And fill the bottom of the grid with a mirror image of the original.

Explanation: In each of the three example images, the top half of the output grid is identical to the top half of the input grid. The bottom half of the output grid is a mirror image of the bottom half of the input grid (mirrored along the horizontal axis). This rule consistently applies to all three examples, making option 5 the correct answer."
210,8d5021e8,1,"4. To make the output, you have to...put the input grid in the corner of your output grid. Then replicate the patterns but invert them.

Explanation: Observing the images provided, we see that in the output grid, the original input grid is placed in one of the corners. Following that, additional blocks are added to the output grid in a pattern that appears to be an inversion of the original, creating a mirrored or inverse effect. Each color block from the original input grid is replicated in an inverted manner, filling out the rest of the output grid accordingly."
211,8d510a79,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...complete a line with the colors. If it's red, fill the line in until you hit the gray bar. If it's blue, fill in until you hit the bottom or top edge.

Explanation: In both given image examples, you can observe that wherever a red square is present, the entire row is filled with red color until it reaches the gray horizontal bar, at which point it stops. Similarly, where a blue square is present, the column is filled with blue color until it reaches the top or bottom edge of the grid. This rule is consistent in both images, confirming that it is the rule used to generate the output grid from the input grid. Options 1 and 2 are incorrect as they involve ignoring or skipping lines, which is not observed in the output. Option 4 is incorrect because black and light blue are not mentioned or relevant colors in the images. Option 5 is incorrect because green and brown are not present in the images, and there is no horizontal brown bar."
212,8e1813be,1,"1. To make the output, you have to...repeat the color lines in the same horizontal or vertical order as they appear in the input. The lines should go all the way across the grid to form stripes that are in the same color order and orientation as the input.

Explanation: In each of the images provided, we can observe that the colored stripes in the input grid have been extended across the entire output grid, maintaining the same order and orientation (either horizontal or vertical). For example, in the first image, the vertical stripes of grey, red, and blue in the input grid appear as vertical stripes in the output grid, filling the full height of the grid, and in the same order. The same applies to the second and third images with horizontal stripes; the colors are extended to fill the entire width of the output grid while maintaining the same sequence as in the input grid."
213,8e5a5113,2,"The correct answer is: 2. To make the output, you have to...copy the first square exactly. Then in the next black square rotate the color pattern 90 degrees to the right. Then in the final black square rotate the pattern another 90 degrees.

Explanation: By examining the images, we can see that the first square in the output grid is a direct copy of the first square in the input grid. In the subsequent squares of the output grid, the color patterns have been rotated; first by 90 degrees to the right, and then by another 90 degrees to the right for the final black square. This creates a consistent pattern across all three image sets provided. The other options do not match the transformations seen in the output grids."
214,8eb1be9a,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid, then copy the exact same pattern to fill in the whole black background.

Explanation: Upon examining the images provided, it's clear that the output grid is a replicated pattern of the input grid stretched to fill the entire available space. There are no new patterns invented, no distortions made, and the original pattern is not completely different; it is simply the same pattern repeated multiple times to cover the entire grid. This eliminates options 1, 2, 4, and 5, and confirms that option 3 is the correct answer."
215,8efcae92,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...make the grid the same size as the shape and the two colors are just like in the shape.

Explanation: In each of the provided images, we can observe that the shape of the grid changes from the input to the output, adjusting to the size of the blue squares, which form a new shape. Moreover, the red squares retain the same relative positions in the output as they had in comparison to the blue squares in the input. Hence, the grid is adjusted to match the size of the blue square shape, and the two colors used in the output (blue and red) are consistent with the colors present in the input shape."
216,8f2ea7aa,5,"The correct option is 2.

Explanation: By examining the input and output patterns across the three provided images, a consistent translation rule can be observed. In each case, the pattern from the input grid, which is a 3x3 grid, is expanded and repeated in specific positions on the 9x9 output grid. Specifically, the pattern is replicated in the top middle, central, and bottom middle 3x3 grids within the larger 9x9 grid.

In the first image, the blue L-shaped pattern from the input grid is transposed into the designated positions on the output grid, maintaining its orientation and relative position within each 3x3 grid. The same process is followed in the second and third images with the orange and pink patterns, respectively.

Thus, option 2 is the correct choice as it accurately describes the transformation rule applied to create the output grid from the input grid."
217,90c28cc7,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...replace group of same color grids with single same color grid.

Explanation: Upon examining the image files closely, it is observed that in the input grid, there are multiple small squares of the same color grouped together. In the corresponding output grid, each group of small squares of the same color is replaced by a single larger square of that same color. For example, in the first image, the input grid has a group of small blue squares, which is replaced by a single larger blue square in the output grid. The same rule applies to groups of small squares of other colors in all three images. Therefore, the correct answer is option 4, as it succinctly explains the transformation process from the input grid to the output grid."
218,90f3ed37,5,"The correct answer is: 

5. To make the output, you have to...finish the line so that it is the same as the top line but finish the line in blue.

Explanation: In all the images, the rule is to continue the pattern from the input grid to match the pattern of the topmost line in the output grid, completing it in blue. The light blue pattern is kept the same but is transformed into dark blue to match the given output, which suggests that any continuation of the line should also be in blue. There is a consistent rule across all examples?”wherever a light blue line starts, it is continued in the output grid with a dark blue line to complete the pattern established by the row above it. The top line in each output grid is the reference for the pattern to follow, thus ""finishing the line so that it is the same as the top line but finishing the line in blue"" is the correct rule applied here."
219,913fb3ed,3,"The correct option is: 3. To make the output, you have to...surround green with pink color, light blue with yellow, and red with blue.

Explanation: In the given image files, we can observe that each colored square in the input grid is surrounded by another color in the output grid. Specifically, the green square is surrounded by pink squares, the light blue square is surrounded by yellow squares, and the red square is surrounded by blue squares. This pattern is consistent across all images, leading to the conclusion that option 3 is the correct rule for creating the output grid from the input grid."
220,91413438,4,"The correct option is:

4. To make the output, you have to...make the output repeat the pattern horizontally from the top of the grid by the number of the colored grid on the background using the unique background explained above.

Explanation: Examining the images, the colored squares in the input grid are replicated in the output grid with a repetition that starts from the top and proceeds horizontally across. The number of times the pattern is repeated correlates to the number of colored squares in the input grid. For instance, in the first image with red squares, there are four colored squares, so the pattern is repeated four times horizontally from the top. Similar patterns of replication are observed in the other images with different colors. Hence, option 4 correctly describes the transformation rule for the given image files."
221,91714a58,2,"The correct option is: 

2. To make the output, you have to...only copy the size and position of the solid rectangular block, except other single colored pixels.

Explanation: Upon examining the images, we can see that each input grid contains various colored squares scattered around, but only one solid rectangle block of the same color is present. In the corresponding output grid, all other colors and shapes are removed, leaving only the solid rectangular block of a single color. The position and size of this rectangular block are consistent with its placement in the input grid. Options 1, 3, 4, and 5 are incorrect as they mention other shapes, colors, or attributes that are not relevant to the rule observed in the image transformations."
222,9172f3a0,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...keep the same color and pattern but increase to a 9x9 grid. Each tile in the input grid is a 3x3 grid pattern on the output.

Explanation: From the examples provided, it can be observed that the color and pattern in the input grid remain the same in the output grid, but the size of the grid has increased to a 9x9 grid. Each square in the input is represented by a smaller 3x3 grid of the same color in the output. The pattern of colors is maintained, meaning if a tile is green in the input, all nine tiles in the corresponding 3x3 grid in the output are also green. Similarly, for red, yellow, and orange tiles in the input grid. This process has been applied consistently in both images, indicating that this is the rule being used to transform the input grid to the output grid."
223,928ad970,2,"The correct answer is: 

2. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid. Then, using the color of the colored rectangle, make the largest rectangle possible that will fit inside the four grey dots. The outside of the new rectangle should touch the inside of all four grey dots.

Explanation: Looking at the provided images, we can see the pattern is consistent across all three examples. Each input grid contains a small colored rectangle and four grey dots positioned in different locations. The output grid shows a larger rectangle of the same color that extends to the edges of the grey dots. The new rectangle is constructed to be the largest possible size while still touching the inside of all four grey dots. The given rule in option 2 describes this transformation process perfectly."
224,93b581b8,2,"2. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid. Then, you will add 4 2x2 blocks to the grid, each touching the corner of the 2x2 colored square in the input. The color of each 2x2 block should be the same color as the opposite corner of the 2x2 colored square. If the 2x2 colored square is not in the center of the input, some of the 2x2 blocks you are adding may be off the page.

Explanation: In each of the provided images, the output grid is created by adding four 2x2 colored blocks to the corners of the central 2x2 colored square in the input grid. Each added 2x2 block matches the color of the opposite corner within the central 2x2 colored square. For instance, in the first image, a red 2x2 block is added to the top left corner of the grid, opposite the red square in the bottom right of the central 2x2, a yellow 2x2 block is added to the top right corner opposite the yellow square in the bottom left, a blue 2x2 block is added to the bottom left corner opposite the blue square in the top right, and a magenta 2x2 block is added to the bottom right corner opposite the magenta square in the top left. The same pattern is followed in the other images. This matches the description in option 2."
225,941d9a10,5,"The correct option is:

5. To make the output, you have to...fill the left-upper black area with blue; the middle with red; and the green in the right-down.

Explanation: In the given images, the rule to create the output grid from the input grid seems to be consistent. In each output grid, the top left-most black area is replaced with blue, the middle black area (in a horizontal band) is replaced with red, and the bottom right-most black area is replaced with green. This pattern is observed across all three examples, which eliminates the other options and confirms that option 5 is the correct answer."
226,94f9d214,4,"The correct answer is: 4. To make the output, you have to...overlay the top 4x4 grid of green pixels over the bottom 4x4 grid of blue pixels or vice versa.

Explanation: In each given image, the green squares are directly on top of the grid and the blue squares are on the bottom of the grid. After overlaying the top grid of green pixels over the bottom grid of blue pixels, wherever there is a green or blue pixel, it is changed to black in the output grid. Conversely, wherever the grids neither overlap green nor blue, those pixels are changed to red in the output grid. There are no instances of both green and blue occupying the same space, so we only see black and red in the output. This rule corresponds to option 4, which correctly describes the transformation process observed in the images."
227,952a094c,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid to the output workspace. Move each of the interior corner colored pixels to the exterior corner opposite of their input position. Meaning, move the upper left interior pixel such that its corner is touching the lower left corner of the lower left corner pixel of the monochromatic rectangle or square. You're moving pixel at a 45 degree angle to the exterior opposite corner, do that with each interior corner square to create the correct output grid.

Explanation: Observing the transformation from the input grid to the output grid in each of the three examples, you can notice that the colored pixels that are not part of the large monochromatic rectangle or square have moved. Specifically, the pixels that are in the interior corner positions in the input grid have been moved to the opposite exterior corners in the output grid. This movement is consistent across all examples, whereby each interior corner pixel is shifted diagonally across the grid to the corresponding opposite exterior corner. None of the movements involve deleting the input grid, reordering to identical interior positions, or copying from the output back to the input, which eliminates options 1, 4, and 5. The correct answer is not option 2 since the movement is from the interior to the exterior corner, not the exterior to the interior. Thus, option 3 provides the correct description of the observed rule for the transformations in the given image files."
228,9565186b,1,"The correct option is: 
1. To make the output, you have to...keep the color with the most squares and everything else should be gray.

Explanation: In each image, we can observe that the color that appears most frequently in the input grid is retained in the output grid, while all other colors are changed to gray. For instance, in the first image, blue is the most common color in the input grid, and in the output grid, all squares except the blue ones have been turned gray. This pattern is consistent across all provided image files, confirming that the rule to create the output grid from the input grid is to keep the color with the most squares and change all others to gray."
229,95990924,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...surround each square with the following, connected diagonally to each of the corners: Blue on the top left, Red on the top right, Green on the bottom left, Yellow on the bottom right. The end result should almost resemble a flower, with a gray center and four colored petals.

Explanation: In each image, the output grid shows a gray square in the center surrounded diagonally by colored squares ??blue, red, green, and yellow in the specified order. This creates a distinct pattern that looks like a flower, with the gray square as the center and each colored square representing a petal. The position of the colors remains consistent relative to the gray square in all three images, confirming that the rule is to surround the gray center square with the colored squares in a diagonal manner, creating a flower-like pattern."
230,963e52fc,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...repeat the same pattern of colors in the input pixels to the grid created in the output in the same position.

Explanation: In all the given image examples, the pattern of colors (red and green in image 1, red and blue in images 2 and 3) in the output grid is identical to the pattern in the corresponding position of the input grid. The output grid is extended horizontally, redistributing the colored pixels across a wider area while maintaining the original sequence and position from the input grid. There is no variation of patterns or change in position from input to output?”only the grids' dimensions are altered."
231,97999447,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid. Then, to the right of the first colored block, place a gray block. After the gray block, continue to the right and place a block of the original color. Continue the pattern of original color followed by gray until you reach the right side. Do this with each original colored block.

Explanation: In all given image files, the output shows that for each colored block in the input grid, a pattern is created toward the right side. This pattern consists of alternating original colored blocks and gray blocks. This process is repeated for each colored block in the input grid until it reaches the right side of the output grid. None of the other rules provided apply to all three images shown. Option 3 is the only consistent pattern observed."
232,97a05b5b,1,"The correct option is: 4. To make the output, you have to...fit the green blocks in the small grid blocks where they go on the large red grid with the colored blocks as well.

Explanation: By examining the images provided, the common rule that can be observed is that the output grid retains the green blocks in their respective positions from the input grid while the rest of the grid is filled with red blocks. The black blocks and any other colors apart from green are not represented in the output grid, which suggests that the rule involves specifically keeping the positions of the green blocks from the input grid. Therefore, option 4 is the correct choice."
233,98cf29f8,1,"1. To make the output, you have to...remove the colored squares that create a floor to the other pattern. you bring the patterns together by moving the pattern that is the same color as the line you remove.

Explanation: In each given image, there is a distinct colored ""floor"" or horizontal row of squares separating two patterns of different colors. To achieve the output from the input, this ""floor"" is removed, allowing the pattern above, which is the same color as the removed ""floor"", to drop down and come together with the pattern below it. This creates the effect seen in the output, where the two previously separated patterns are now adjacent."
234,995c5fa3,2,"1. To make the output, you have to...make three rows of two different solid colors corresponding to the grey 4x4 blocks. The first 4x4 block is the color of the top row, and so on. Grey 4x4 with a 2x2 black box in the middle = light blue. Grey 4x4 with black = red. Grey 4x4 with black box center bottom = yellow. Grey 4x4 with no 1x2 black lines on the left and right = green. If there are any more, they are a different color.

Explanation: Upon reviewing the images provided and comparing the input grids to the output grids, we can deduce the following pattern:

- The output grids consist of three rows with two different solid colors.
- The colors in the output are determined by the specific configurations of the black areas in each grey 4x4 block of the input:
   - A grey 4x4 block containing a 2x2 black box in the middle translates to light blue.
   - A grey 4x4 block containing black translates to red.
   - A grey 4x4 block with a black box center bottom translates to yellow.
   - A grey 4x4 block with no 1x2 black lines on the left and right translates to green.
- The position of each colored row in the output grid corresponds to the same position as the grey 4x4 block in the input grid.

Matching this pattern across all images confirms that option 1 accurately describes the rule to create the output grid from the input grid."
235,99b1bc43,1,"1. To make the output, you have to...compare the squares in the top and bottom 4x4 square. If they match (both black or both color) make the output square black. If they do not match, make the output square green.

Explanation: Upon examining the given images, it is clear that the output grid is created by comparing the top 4x4 grid with the bottom 4x4 grid in the input. In the output grid, a square is black if the corresponding squares in the top and bottom grid are the same (either both black or both colored). Conversely, a square is green in the output grid if the corresponding squares in the top and bottom grid do not match (one is black and the other is colored). This rule is consistently followed across all provided images."
236,99fa7670,1,"1. Explanation: Looking at each pair of input and output grids, the rule is consistently applied: the colored block in the input grid is extended horizontally towards the right edge of the grid until it is either interrupted by another colored block or reaches the edge. Once the block has reached as far as it can horizontally, it then continues to extend downward vertically, again, until it either meets another colored block or reaches the bottom edge of the grid. This rule is clearly observed in each of the provided image examples, making option 1 the correct answer."
237,9aec4887,2,"2. To make the output, you have to...copy the colored object and copy the light blue object inside the colored object. Then change the middle light blue blocks adjacent to the colored outlines to the same color.

Explanation: In each example, the colored object is replicated from the input grid to the output grid. The light blue object inside the colored object is also replicated exactly within the colored object's outline. The exception is the light blue blocks that are directly adjacent to the inside edge of the colored outline. These light blue blocks are changed to the same color as the adjacent outline color in the output grid. This rule is consistently applied across all the provided examples."
238,9af7a82c,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...straighten out the shapes to become lines, hanging from the top of the new grid. The shapes will be arranged by length, longest starting at the left and shortest at the right. The largest shape should start at the top left and extend all the way down to fill the grid. The next biggest shape will fill in next to it and extend down the number of blocks of the original shape. The next smallest shape will go next extend down the number of blocks of the original shape. Do this until all shapes fill the grid horizontally. The empty space extending below the straightened shapes (now lines) in the bottom-right of the grid will be black.

Explanation: Upon examining the provided images, one can observe that each row of the input grid has been transformed into a column in the output grid, maintaining their respective colors and the number of squares in each. In the output grid, these colored lines run from top to bottom, starting from the leftmost column and sequenced by the number of squares (or length) of each color in the input grid, from the most to the least number of squares. The remaining unfilled cells in the output grid are colored black, which can be seen at the bottom part of the grid. This pattern corresponds exactly to option 5, making it the correct choice."

240,9dfd6313,5,"The correct option is: 

5. To make the output, you have to...rotate the pattern 90 degrees to the right and then flip it over to its reverse. The output should be a 90 degrees mirror image of the input.

Explanation: Upon examining the given images, it is evident that the input patterns have been transformed into the output patterns by first rotating them 90 degrees to the right (a quarter turn clockwise), and then flipping them over to their reverse or mirror image. This is confirmed by the placement and orientation of the colored squares in the output grid compared to the input grid."
241,9ecd008a,2,"The correct option is: 

4. To make the output, you have to...finish the design that would be in the black square section.

Explanation:
In all the provided images, the output grid appears to be a simplified and completed version of the pattern that the black square in the input grid is a part of. The black square represents a missing section of a larger, simplistic design. The output grid reconstructs this design into a coherent pattern, disregarding all other color patterns present in the input grid. The output is achieved by identifying the design pattern that the black square interrupts and completing that design in a simplified, usually solid color form."
242,9edfc990,2,"The correct answer is 4. Explanation: In the output grid, we can see that every space where there was a blue block in the input grid is now filled with blue. In spaces where there were other colors or were empty in the input grid, they have been filled with black in the output grid. There is no space left empty in the output grid, which rules out options 1, 2, 3, and 5. Option 4 correctly identifies that the output grid fills in where the blue blocks were with blue, and fills in all other spaces with black."
243,9f236235,1,"1. Explanation: Upon examining the images, it can be observed that in the output grid, only the pattern of boxes from the input grid is mirrored horizontally without the lines that originally formed the boxes. The pattern is consistent in all three images, where the leftmost columns in the input grid become the rightmost columns in the output grid, and vice versa, reflecting a horizontal flip. Therefore, the correct rule is to avoid the lines that create the boxes, and instead focus on the pattern, mirroring it horizontally to create the output grid."
244,a1570a43,1,"1. To make the output, you have to...think of the 4 pixels as a picture frame. Reposition the random shape to be centered in that frame.

Explanation: Upon examining the images provided, a pattern can be observed where the arrangement of colored blocks in the output grid appears to be a centered version of a random shape present in the input grid. The 4 green pixels seemingly represent the corners of an invisible central frame or area in which the red-shaded shape is to be centered. This central framing of the red blocks relative to the green corner pixels is consistent across all given examples."
245,a2fd1cf0,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...create a road of light blue squares between the red and green squares. The road should travel up or down from the green square and left or right from the red square until the two meet.

Explanation: Upon examining the provided image files, it seems that the consistent rule across all images is to create a path of light blue squares connecting the red and green squares. In every output grid, the light blue squares form a path that travels either vertically from the green square or horizontally from the red square, until they link together, forming a continuous road. There are no yellow, pink, or black squares that play a part in these transformations. Additionally, the path is made of squares, not rectangles, eliminating option 5. Hence, the most appropriate option matching the given images is number 4."
246,a3325580,1,"4. To make the output, you have to...will be brought to life by making vertical rows of the same color boxes with the smallest number of colors.

Explanation: In all given images, the output grid consists of vertical rows of the same color boxes. Each vertical row matches the color of the box in the input grid that occurs in the greatest number per color. Therefore, it is apparent that the rule is to take the color that occurs the most frequently in each color group in the input grid and create a vertical row in the output grid with this color. Since we are only creating rows for the colors with the smallest number (in this case, each color only creates one row regardless of how many boxes of that color are present), option 4 correctly describes the rule."
247,a3df8b1e,1,"4. To make the output, you have to...will be brought to life by making vertical rows of the same color boxes with the smallest number of colors.

Explanation: In all given images, the output grid consists of vertical rows of the same color boxes. Each vertical row matches the color of the box in the input grid that occurs in the greatest number per color. Therefore, it is apparent that the rule is to take the color that occurs the most frequently in each color group in the input grid and create a vertical row in the output grid with this color. Since we are only creating rows for the colors with the smallest number (in this case, each color only creates one row regardless of how many boxes of that color are present), option 4 correctly describes the rule."
248,a416b8f3,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...copy the pattern exactly to the new empty section. There should be two of the same pattern side-by-side.

Explanation: In the given images, the output grid is showing an exact copy of the input grid pattern replicated next to it. We can observe this by looking at the colors and the arrangement of the colored squares, which are identical in both the input and output grids, creating two side-by-side patterns with the same arrangement. There are no changes or inversions in the pattern, and the number of patterns is two, not three. Therefore, option 5 is the correct answer."
249,a48eeaf7,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...move the blocks until they touch the red square on the same line.

Explanation: In both provided images, the pattern that is consistent is that the gray blocks are moved within the same horizontal line (row) to touch the red square. In the first image, the single gray block is moved to the right to touch the red square. In the second image, the two gray blocks are moved to the left to become adjacent to the red square. There are no yellow squares, green rectangles, brown squares, or circles present, and the red squares are not on a different line; they remain on the same line. Hence, option 5 is the correct answer."
250,a5313dff,4,"The correct answer is: 
1. To make the output, you have to...color the outside blue but if the border of shape goes outside the grid leave outside black.

Explanation: In all three images provided, the pattern within the grid that has its border fully enclosed within the grid is colored blue on the outside. This means that any part of the pattern that touches the edge of the grid is left black, indicating that the rule is to color the outside only if the entire shape is contained within the grid. If the border of the shape extends beyond the grid, the outside is left black. None of the shapes are colored gray, red, green, or left white as per the other options, ruling them out. The consistent factor in all three output images is the blue coloring on the outside of fully enclosed shapes, making option 1 the correct choice."
251,a5f85a15,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...replicate the input grid, then change the color of every even-numbered pixel starting from the top-left pixel of each diagonal line to yellow.

Explanation: By closely examining the images, it's noticeable that the pattern among all the outputs involves changing the color of certain pixels along the diagonal lines of the grid to yellow. This change follows a consistent rule where every even-numbered pixel counting from the top-left pixel of each diagonal line is changed to yellow. In the first example, there's a single pixel changed on the first diagonal line, two pixels on the second diagonal line, and so on. The same pattern is followed in the rest of the examples, verifying that the rule is to change the color of every even-numbered pixel on the diagonal line to yellow. Options 1, 2, 4, and 5 do not accurately describe the observed consistency in the changes made to the output grids."
252,a61ba2ce,2,"2. To make the output, you have to... follow the colored pattern and put them on all the corners exactly how the pattern is placed. Then fill in the middle 4 squares with black.

Explanation: In the given images, the output grid shows that each colored block from the input grid has been moved to the corresponding corner of the output grid exactly as they were positioned in the input grid. For example, in the first image, we see that the blue block in the top left of the input grid is now in the top left corner of the output grid, the red block is in the bottom left corner of the output grid, and the yellow block is in the bottom right corner of the output grid. The middle four squares of the output grid, regardless of what the input grid looked like, are filled with black. The same pattern is observed in the second image as well. This consistent rule aligns with option 2."
253,a61f2674,2,"The correct answer is: 5

Explanation: By examining the input grid and the output grid, we can see that the shortest group of gray blocks in the input grid has been changed to red in the output grid. Similarly, the tallest group of gray blocks has been changed to blue in the output grid. All of the remaining gray blocks have been turned black. There are no green, yellow, pink, or light blue blocks present in the output, eliminating options 1, 3, and 4. Therefore, the answer is option 5."
254,a64e4611,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...fill the black grid with green surrounding with continue black grid.

Explanation: Upon examining the images, we can see that the black squares that are surrounded by other black squares continue to remain black in the output grid, and all other squares are filled with green. This rule applies consistently to each of the three given images, making option 5 the correct choice."
255,a65b410d,2,"2. To make the output, you have to...copy your red input boxes to the output grid. And then, you need to add green bars above the red bar and blue bars below it, all attached to the left side. Furthermore, the green bar should increase in length by one square each time it moves up from the red bar, while the blue bar should decrease in length by one square each time it moves away from the red bar. The green bar continues this process all the way up to the top of the grid, while the blue bar repeats until it becomes one square in length.

Explanation: The images show that the red bars are copied directly to the output grid in the same position. Above the red bars, green bars are placed with increasing length one square at a time as you move up, starting from the length of the red bar. Below the red bars, blue bars are placed with decreasing length one square at a time as you move down, starting from the length of the red bar until it's one square in length. This pattern matches the description in option 2."
256,a68b268e,1,"The correct option is:

2. To make the output, you have to...take the top left 4x4 on output. add top right 4x4 pattern. cover the first color. do the same for each section.

Explanation: Upon examining the images, it is observed that the output grid is formed by overlapping the top left 4x4 section of the input grid with the pattern found in the top right 4x4 section of the input grid. The first color seen in the top right pattern is used to cover corresponding cells in the output grid regardless of the color beneath it. This rule is consistently followed across all given example images, resulting in the created output grids."
257,a699fb00,1,"The correct option is 1.

Explanation: In each example provided, the pattern is consistent: wherever there is a black section (or sections) between two blue sections, those black sections are filled with the color red. There are no instances where green is used, and the pattern does not involve filling sections between two black or two red sections. Therefore, the correct answer is option 1, which states, ""To make the output, you have to...fill the black sections between two blue sections with red."""
258,a740d043,3,"The correct answer for each image is:

1. Option 3, Explanation: The output shows a rectangle containing the full colored pattern (red and green squares) copied from the input, with the surrounding blue background replaced with black.

2. Option 3, Explanation: Again, the output shows a rectangle containing the full colored pattern (red and green squares) copied from the input, with the surrounding blue background replaced with black.

3. Option 3, Explanation: Similar to the first two images, the output shows a rectangle containing the full colored pattern (gray and pink squares) copied from the input, with the surrounding blue background replaced with black."
259,a78176bb,1,"3. To make the output, you have to...keep the original diagonal color and fill the grey color with black. copy the same diagonal color on the grey color side by keeping space number of original rectangle size made by grey color.

Explanation: In each image, the diagonal line of colored squares running from top left to bottom right remains unchanged in the output grid. The grey squares adjacent to this diagonal are changed to black, and the pattern of the colored diagonal is then mirrored on the opposite side of these newly black squares, adhering to the original rectangle's size formed by the grey squares. This rule is consistently applied in each example. The other options mention changing the original diagonal color, filling grey with blue, or keeping space for a hollow square or the original square size, none of which match the pattern observed."
260,a79310a0,1,"The correct option is: 

1. To make the output, you have to...move colored square one line down and change to red.

Explanation: Upon examining the input and output grids in the given images, we can observe that in each case, the blue colored square in the input grid is moved one line down in the output grid, and its color is changed to red. This rule is consistently applied in all three examples, making option 1 the correct answer."
261,a85d4709,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...check the position of the grey pixels. Where the grey pixel is in the first column, the corresponding pixels in that raw in the output should have color red. If the pixel is in the middle column, the corresponding pixels in the output should be yellow. Where the grey pixel is in the the last column, the corresponding pixel in that raw in the output should be green.

Explanation: Upon examining the images provided, the constant element across all input grids is the placement of grey pixels. In each case, the transformation from the input grid to the output grid follows the rule set out in option 3. Wherever a grey pixel appears in the first column of the input grid, the entire row in the corresponding output grid is red; a grey pixel in the middle column of the input translates to the entire row being yellow in the output; and finally, a grey pixel in the last column of the input grid results in the entire row being green in the output grid. This pattern is consistent across all the examples provided, confirming that option 3 is the correct transformation rule."
262,a87f7484,4,"The correct option is: 

4. To make the output, you have to... find unique 3x3 pattern and replicate this 3x3 grid pattern to the output grid.

Explanation: 

Upon examining the images, we can observe that the output grid is composed of a 3x3 pattern selected from the input grid. The unique 3x3 pattern is identified by finding the squares that have a distinctly colored square in the center, surrounded by black squares. This pattern is then replicated in the output grid, maintaining the same position of the colored square relative to the black squares. The output grid is created by repeating this unique 3x3 pattern to fill the entire grid."
263,a8c38be5,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...make sure the background is all gray. Then place the colors and shapes you see in the input in the right place. The corners should go in the corners. the t-shape should go at the top in the middle, the upside down t-shape should go at the bottom in the middle, the two side way t-shapes should go on the left and right side in the middle so that the long side is against to the left and right. Make sure to keep the same colors for each.

Explanation: By analyzing the images provided, one can notice that there's a consistent pattern in the output. The background is always gray, the corner squares are placed in their respective corners, and the T shapes are systematically arranged in the center with each directionally oriented T shape at its specific location. Importantly, the colors for each shape remain consistent between the input and the output grids, indicating that the rule includes maintaining the original colors for each shape."
264,a8d7556c,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...find where squares bigger than 1 by 1 can be form. Fill those with red.

Explanation: In all three examples provided, the consistent change from the input grid to the output grid is that certain groups of black squares are filled with color in the output grid. The colored groups are all larger than a single 1x1 square, indicating that the rule involves identifying larger squares. The color used to fill these squares in all examples is red, not green or blue. Thus, the correct rule is to find where squares larger than 1x1 can be formed and fill those squares with red. Option 4 is the only one that accurately describes this process using squares (not rectangles), specifies that the squares are larger than 1x1, and indicates they are filled with red."
265,a9f96cdd,4,"The correct answer is 4. To make the output, you have to...make the pixels touching the colored pixel at its corners colored in green for the top left corner pixel, pink for the pixel touching its top right corner, light blue for the pixel touching its bottom left corner and orange for the pixel touching its bottom right corner. The colored pixel in the input should be colored black.

Explanation:
Examining the provided images, we can see that in each output grid, the colored pixel from the input grid changes to black, and the four pixels that touch its corners are colored in specific colors:

- The pixel touching the top left corner is colored green.
- The pixel touching the top right corner is colored pink.
- The pixel touching the bottom left corner is colored light blue.
- The pixel touching the bottom right corner is colored orange.

This pattern is consistent across all output grids when compared with their corresponding input grids. Therefore, option 4 accurately describes the transformation rule applied to create the output grid from the input grid."
266,aabf363d,1,"The correct answer is: 

1. To make the output, you have to...make the box at the bottom left corner black and the colored object at the center the color of the box at the bottom left corner.

Explanation: This rule applies to both image examples provided. In the first image, the bottom left corner is pink, and the output shows the central object changed to pink after making the bottom left corner black. In the second image, the bottom left corner is yellow, and the output shows the central object changed to yellow after making the bottom left corner black."
267,aba27056,5,"The correct option is:

5. To make the output, you have to...fill in the pattern with yellow, color the black squares that make a straight line to the edge of the grid yellow, and create one yellow diagonal line from the line to the edge.

Explanation: In all three given images, we observe that the output grid on the right has yellow squares filling in the pattern that was initially a different color on the input grid on the left. Additionally, any black squares that are aligned in a straight line reaching the edge of the grid have been colored yellow. Finally, a single yellow diagonal line is created extending from these lines to the edge of the grid as well. This pattern of coloring and line creation with yellow is consistent across all examples, hence, option 5 is the correct choice."
268,ac0a08a4,2,"The correct option is 2.

Explanation: From the given images, it is clear that the rule being applied to create the output grid from the input grid is to expand the size of each colored square. In the first image, the green square in the input grid becomes a 3x3 square in the output grid because the initial green square had an area of 3 squares (1x3). Similarly, the orange square in the input grid becomes a 4x4 square in the output grid because the initial orange square had an area of 4 squares (2x2). 

This rule holds for the other two images provided as well. The red and orange squares in the second image and the yellow, blue, and magenta squares in the third image also expand to a size that matches the square of the number of squares they had in the input grid. Therefore, the rule involves squaring the number of colored squares to determine the area of the color in the output grid, which matches option 2."
269,ae3edfdc,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...create 2 patterns using all of the colored boxes in the input grid. One pattern is focused on the red box and the other one is focused on the blue box. Both the red box and the blue box will be in their exact same positions in the new grid. First put the red box in the same place as it is in the input grid. Now, look at the green boxes in the input grid and imagine that the green boxes are being pulled toward the red box until they are touching it. So, if there is a green box in the input grid above the red box, place it directly above the red box in the new grid. If there is a green box to the right of the red box in the input side, move it until it is directly to the right of the red box. Do the same for any other green boxes. After you are done, all of the green boxes should be touching the red box which is still in its original location. That pattern is done. Now use the same exact method for the blue box and surround it with the orange boxes. Think of the blue and red boxes as the centers of flowers and the green and orange boxes as the petals.

Explanation: By examining the transformation from the input grid to the output grid across all three images, it becomes clear that the central red square stays in the same position while all green squares are moved to surround the red square. Similarly, the blue square remains in place while the orange squares are relocated to touch the blue square, just like a flower's petals surrounding its center. Options 1, 2, 3, and 5 do not correctly describe the observed transformation between input and output. Option 4 is therefore the right answer."
270,ae4f1146,4,"The correct answer is: 

4. To make the output, you have to...copy the 3x3 square from the input grid that has the most blue pixels.

Explanation: In each given example, the output grid displays a 3x3 square section taken from the input grid. The selected section contains the highest count of blue pixels as compared to other 3x3 sections in the input grid. This indicates that the rule being applied is to identify and replicate the 3x3 square with the maximum number of blue pixels from the input grid to the output grid."
271,aedd82e4,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid. Any shapes which only contain one single square should be colored blue.

Explanation: In all the given image files, the output grid is an exact copy of the input grid with one notable change: any standalone squares (shapes which only contain one single square) have been colored blue. There is no rotation, resizing, or mirroring happening between the input and output grids. The pattern is consistent across all image files, making option 3 the correct answer."
272,af902bf9,2,"The correct answer is: 2. To make the output, you have to...put red in the middle of the yellow square structure, but not actually next to any of the yellow squares.

Explanation: In all the images provided, the rule being followed is that a red square (or group of red squares) is placed in the central position of the area that forms a larger square shape outlined by yellow squares. This red square(s) is not directly adjacent to any of the yellow squares, but is rather surrounded by empty black grid spaces. The red squares occupy the central position within the boundaries of the larger square outlined by the yellow squares."
273,b0c4d837,3,"The correct option is 3. 

Explanation: Based on the images provided, we can observe the following pattern:

- When the blue blocks form a 2x2 square in the center, only the top left block in the output grid is colored blue.
- When the blue blocks form a 3x3 square in the center, the top row of the output grid is filled with blue blocks.
- When the blue blocks form a 2x1 or 1x2 pattern in the center, two blue blocks appear in the top row of the output grid (either the two leftmost or two rightmost, corresponding to their position in the input grid).
- When the blue blocks form a 4x2 rectangle in the center, the top row of the output grid is filled with blue blocks except for the rightmost block. 

The pattern on the output grid follows the transformations of the light blue blocks in the input grid, and the option that matches this pattern exactly is option 3."
274,b190f7f5,3,"The correct option is: 

5. To make the output, you have to...substitute each of the colored grids with a yellow color grid pattern.

Explanation:

Upon examining the three sets of input and output grids, it is clear that each colored square in the input grid (regardless of its original color) has been changed to a yellow square in the output grid. The position of the colored squares is maintained; only the color is changed to yellow. All of the other options are incorrect because they suggest substituting the colored grids with different colors or patterns which is not observed in the provided images."
275,b1948b0a,5,"The correct option is 5.

Explanation: In all of the given images, the transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves changing the color of all the purple squares to red. All the squares that were originally purple in the input grid have been turned to red in the output grid, while the orange squares remain unchanged. There are no blue, green, or yellow squares present in the input grids, so options 2, 3, and 4 are incorrect. Option 1 is also incorrect as it suggests changing red squares to purple, which is not the case in the images provided. Therefore, the only correct answer is option 5."
276,b230c067,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...color the two similar shapes the same blue color and then change the third shape to the red color.

Explanation: In the given images, we can observe that the output grid always has two shapes colored blue and one shape colored red. The two blue shapes are identical in form while the red shape is different from them. The rule being applied consistently across both images is: identical shapes are colored blue, and the one shape that is different from the others is colored red."
277,b27ca6d3,1,"The correct option is: 

1. To make the output, you have to...place green boxes all the way around all of the paired red boxes.

Explanation: In the given image files, we see red boxes on the left that are positioned in such a way that if paired, they would be adjacent to each other either horizontally or vertically. The output images on the right show green boxes surrounding the groups of two or more adjacent red boxes, essentially forming a perimeter around them. There are no green boxes around singular, non-paired red boxes. Therefore, the common rule in creating the output grid from the input grid is to place green boxes surrounding all the paired red boxes."
278,b2862040,1,"The correct answer is: 1. To make the output, you have to...change closed patterns to light blue.

Explanation: In all the provided images, the transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves changing the color of the closed patterns (areas that are completely enclosed by blue squares) to light blue. For example, in the first image, the 'H' pattern has a closed center that becomes light blue in the output grid. Similarly, in the subsequent images, any sections that are completely surrounded by blue squares have their color changed to light blue in the output. Open patterns (areas not completely enclosed) remain unchanged. Therefore, option 1 is the correct answer."
279,b527c5c6,2,"1. Explanation: In each image, the single small red square is extended all the way to the edge of the grid in the direction towards the larger area with the other color, which is green. At the end of the extended red line, it is met with a larger block of the green color which is the same number of squares in thickness as the distance between the original red square and the start of the red line. The green block covers the red line and extends downwards, matching the amount of steps taken from the initial red square to the grid's edge. The red square always maintains its position relative to the green color, either stretching towards it or aligning with it if it's already on the edge. This pattern is consistently observed in all given images."
280,b548a754,2,"The correct answer is: 

2. To make the output, you have to...stretch it until the outer color covers the dot and then fill in the shape with the inner color from where the outer square or rectangle is. This should stretch the shape in general towards the dot itself.

Explanation: In all three given images, the transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves stretching the larger shape towards the smaller colored dot. In the process, the larger shape (square or rectangle) expands to cover the area where the dot is located. After the outer shape has been stretched to cover the dot, the inner color fills in the newly covered areas, maintaining the original configuration of colors within the expanded shape. There are no circles or hexagons in any of the images, so option 4 can be eliminated. Options 1, 3, and 5 are incorrect because the inner shape is not unfilled, shrunk, or compressed in any of the examples. The action described in option 2 accurately reflects the consistent rule applied across all three images."

282,b6afb2da,2,"2. To make the output, you have to...stay the squares in the same place but change color. The corner become blue. The middle become red. The edge between the corner become yellow.

Explanation: In both images, the grey squares in the corners have become blue, the grey squares in the center have become red, and the grey squares between the corners (along the edges) have become yellow. The position of the squares has not changed; only their colors have been altered following the pattern described in option 2."
283,b7249182,5,"The correct option is 5.

Explanation: By observing the images, we see that in each case, the colored squares are extended in a line toward the center of the grid from their starting position. In the output grid, there is an empty space made in the center by stopping the extension of the lines 1 square before they meet, resulting in 2 black squares in the center. There is also a new line on each side with 2 cubes for each color, with an additional colored cube placed at the end of these lines. This connects each colored line and forms an empty space in the center with a size of 2x3. This pattern holds true for all three examples provided, making option 5 the correct choice."
284,b775ac94,1,"1. Explanation: In the images provided, the transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves expanding the uniquely colored cells (those different from the main block of color) into a pattern that mirrors and mimics the form of the original cells. The pattern created in the output grid has a resemblance to a snowflake where different colors are mirrored to create a symmetrical pattern. For example, in the first image, the yellow and green cells are expanded to form a three-quarter snowflake pattern with the red cells. In the second image, the lighter and darker blue cells form half a snowflake with the yellow cells due to their original positioning. Similarly, in the third image, the pink cells form a quarter snowflake with the red and blue cells. The pattern expansion respects the original placement of the uniquely colored cells and creates a symmetrical pattern akin to a snowflake, supporting option 1 as the correct answer."
285,b782dc8a,3,"Unfortunately, without provided images, I'm unable to choose the correct answer. If you can provide the images or describe the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, I would be able to give you the correct option number and the explanation."
286,b8825c91,4,"The correct option is: 3. To make the output, you have to...keep the yellow rectangles and alter the color to match the existing pattern.

Explanation: Upon inspecting the provided images, it's clear that the yellow rectangles present in the input grid remain yellow in the output grid. The rest of the colors in the output grid seem to follow the same pattern and positioning as in the input grid, with no additions or removals of shapes or alteration of the pattern itself. The rule that appears to have been applied consistently across all examples is that the yellow rectangles are maintained, and the other colors are adjusted to ensure they match the existing pattern. The other options either do not apply or inaccurately describe the transformation from input to output."
287,b8cdaf2b,1,"3. To make the output, you have to...create a diagonal line from the top to the sides with the more majority color.

Explanation: In each image, we see a pattern where a diagonal line is formed from the top center of the grid to both sides. This diagonal line is made up of the color that appears most in the bottom row of the input grid. For instance, in the first image, the bottom row of the input grid has more pink blocks than blue, so the output grid shows a diagonal line of pink blocks. Similarly, in subsequent images, the diagonal line in the output grid is formed by the color with the most blocks in the bottom row of the input grid (yellow in the second and third, green in the fourth). Hence, the rule is to create a diagonal line with the more majority color."
288,b91ae062,5,"The correct option is:

5. To make the output, you have to...count the number of colors in input, then according to the count, each grid size is changed within each block. And each block should be colored as same in input.

Explanation: For each of the given images, the output grid has been transformed in such a way that the number of smaller blocks within each larger block corresponds to the number of different colors present in the input grid's larger block. The colors of the smaller blocks in the output are the same as the colors found in the input. 

For example, in the first image, the top right block of the input grid contains two colors, thereby the output grid's corresponding block is divided into two smaller blocks of the same colors. This pattern continues in all the images; the division of blocks in the output directly correlates to the number of different colors in the input, making option 5 the correct answer."
289,b94a9452,1,"1. To make the output, you have to...make an output grid that is the same size as the larger square. The size and placement of the smaller inner square should be the same relative to the input grid. The colors of the two squares should be swapped.

Explanation: In each of the given images, the output grid is identical in size to the largest square in the input grid. The smaller square maintains its size and position within this grid. Furthermore, the colors are inverted, such that the color of the larger square in the input becomes the color of the smaller square in the output, and vice versa."
290,b9b7f026,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...fill in the new grid with the color of the object that has a hole in it.

Explanation: By examining the given images, we can see a common rule: the color of the output grid corresponds to the object in the input grid that contains a hole (or a white space). For instance, in the first image, the object with a hole is red, in the second image, the object with a hole is gray, and in the third image, the object with a hole is magenta. Hence, the correct answer is option 5."
291,ba26e723,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...start by changing the first set of two blocks to pink. Then skip two pairs and change the next two pink. Complete this pattern to the end of the grid.

Explanation: Upon examining the given images, we can see that the pattern in the output grid consists of the first two yellow blocks changing to pink, followed by two pairs of unchanged yellow blocks. The next two yellow blocks change to pink again, and this pattern repeats until the end of the grid. Option 4 accurately describes the transformation from the input grid to the output grid, matching the observed pattern. The other options either do not match the pattern (as they suggest changing three blocks or skipping three pairs) or suggest an incorrect color change (to blue instead of pink)."
292,ba97ae07,4,"4. To make the output, you have to... copy the input grid. In the output, change the color where the two lines meet so that the other color line is on top.

Explanation: In each pair of input and output grids, both grids start the same with two perpendicular colored lines over a black background. The interaction between the two colored lines changes in the output grid. Where the two colored lines intersect, the color of the intersecting squares changes to the color of the other line, creating the illusion that the line with the color change is now on top of the other line. This rule consistently applies to all given examples, which is why option 4 is correct."
293,bb43febb,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...fill the inside of both shapes with red leaving a border the same color as original.

Explanation: In the given image files, the input grid shows shapes made up of grey squares with a black border. In the output grid, the same shapes are filled with red squares, but the border remains the same color (grey in the shape and black for grid lines) as in the original input grid. This rule applies to all the shapes within the grid, regardless of their size or location, hence option 3 correctly describes the transformation from the input to the output grid. Options 1, 2, 4, and 5 do not precisely describe the observed patterns."
294,bbc9ae5d,4,"The correct answer is: 4. To make the output, you have to...make the top row the same as the row shown in the input grid. Every row that goes down adds one more colored box. So, if the top row has 4 colored boxes, the next row down has 5 and then the next row has 6...etc. This will look like a staircase when you are done. Keep going until the grid is finished.

Explanation: In each example image provided, the top row of the output grid replicates the arrangement of colored and uncolored boxes from the input grid. Then, in each successive row as you move downward, one additional colored box is added to the sequence, forming a staircase pattern that extends to the right edge of the output grid. This pattern continues for each row until the grid is complete, which satisfies the conditions described in option 4."
295,bc1d5164,1,"The correct option is: 

1. To make the output, you have to... imagine you are squishing the original grid horizontally and vertically. The colored dots move and overlap on top of the background.

Explanation: 
In all the given images, the transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves a compression of the grid both horizontally and vertically. The colored squares that are separated in the input grid come closer together in the output grid as if the space between them has been squished. The movement of the colored squares towards each other in the output grid suggests a horizontal and vertical compression of the input grid."
296,bd4472b8,2,"2. Explanation: By looking at the three given image files, we can discern a recurring pattern. In each case, the third row and the rows that follow after the gray row adopt the colors from the first row in a left-to-right manner. This pattern repeats itself once every color from the first row has been used. Notably, this rule holds true for all the examples, regardless of the number of colors or the particular shades present in the first row. Therefore, the correct answer is option 2, which states that to create the output, one must ""start on the third row (after the row of gray) and make the entire third row the same as the first color in the first row, then make the entire fourth row the same as the second color in the first row, and so on for the next color. Once all colors have been done, then repeat the same pattern."""
297,bda2d7a6,2,"The correct option is 3.

Explanation: In each of the three image examples, the color of the central 2x2 grid (originally black) has been changed to match the original color of the outer 6x6 grid. The color of the 4x4 grid surrounding the 2x2 grid has been changed to match the original color of the 2x2 grid, and the color of the 6x6 grid has been changed to match the original color of the 4x4 grid. This pattern is consistent across all three images, confirming that option 3 best describes the transformation applied to the input grids to produce the output grids."
298,bdad9b1f,2,"2, Explanation: In the provided images, the input grid on the left has a pattern of blue squares running vertically and red squares running horizontally. To create the output grid on the right, the rule is to extend the pattern of red squares horizontally and the pattern of blue squares vertically until they reach the edge of the grid. Where the red and blue squares intersect, the square is colored yellow. This rule is consistent with the transformation observed in both images. Therefore, option 2 is the correct answer."
299,be94b721,5,"1. Explanation: After examining the given images, it is observed that the output grid always fully zooms out the pattern with the highest number of colored cells in the input grid, occupying the entire output grid with that color. In each case, we can count the number of colored cells for each color and the color with the most cells is expanded to fill the output grid. For example, in the first image, the yellow color has the highest count of colored cells in the input grid, and the output grid is entirely filled with yellow. Similarly, for the other images, the output grid is filled with the color that has the highest count in the input grid. Therefore, the correct answer is option 1."
300,beb8660c,5,"1. To make the output, you have to...rearrange the lines from smallest at the bottom of the grid to largest at the top. The final row need not be at the top of the grid. The lines should be aligned to the left side.

Explanation: In each provided image, you can see that the colored boxes are rearranged in ascending order from bottom to top based on the number of boxes in each line, with the smallest at the bottom and the largest at the top. It is also clear that the final row does not need to be at the top of the grid if there are not enough lines to fill the entire grid. Lastly, each line starts from the left side and continues uninterrupted to the right, showing that the boxes should indeed be aligned to the left side."
301,c0f76784,2,"2. To make the output, you have to...fill the center of the smallest square with pink, the middle square with orange color and the biggest square with light blue.

Explanation: On analyzing the input and output grids in all three images, we can observe that the pattern follows a consistent rule in terms of coloring the center of the squares. The smallest square, depicted in the input with its respective shape, is always filled with a pink color in the output grid. The middle square is always filled with orange, and the largest square is filled with light blue. This rule applies to each example provided, fulfilling the task to identify the common rule for creating the output grid from the input grid. Options 1, 3, 4, and 5 do not match the consistent pattern observed in the images."
302,c1d99e64,5,"The correct option is: 

5. To make the output, you have to...color the black squares that create a line vertical or horizontal all the way across the grid red and only those squares red.

Explanation: In each of the given images, we can observe that the transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves changing the color of certain black squares to red. Specifically, the squares that are part of a continuous vertical or horizontal line across the entire grid are colored red. This rule is consistent across all the images, as we can see that only those black squares that make up a full line across the grid are changed to red, while the others remain their original color. Therefore, option 5 correctly describes the rule for creating the output grid from the input grid."
303,c3e719e8,1,"The correct option is:

1. To make the output, you have to...notice that you can copy the original 3x3 grid 9 times into the new grid (nine 3x3 patterns) and fill out the new grid in this pattern. Now look at which color is the most common in the input grid and keep that in mind. For example, if blue is the most common color in the input box and the top, left box is blue then copy the entire 3x3 box into the top, left 3x3 area in the new grid. If the bottom, middle box is blue then copy the entire 3x3 grid into the middle top of the new grid. Alternatively, suppose the top right box is red (or any other color that is not the most common) in the input grid...then that top right 3x3 area should be black in the new grid. Keep following that pattern until you're done. The black holes should now correlate to the locations of the colors of the boxes (in the input grid) that were not the most common.

Explanation: By examining the input and output grids in each image, it can be deduced that the most common color of the input grid is replicated in the same position on the output grid across nine 3x3 patterns. Any color that is not the most common is represented as a black box in the corresponding 3x3 area in the output grid. This pattern is consistent across all given image files."
304,c3f564a4,5,"The correct option is: 5. To make the output, you have to...fill in black tiles with the same tile pattern in the diagonal lines.

Explanation: Upon examining the provided images, it is evident that each output grid has been created by filling in the black (empty) tiles with the same colored tiles following the pattern of the diagonal lines from the corresponding input grid. In all three image examples, the pattern of the colored tiles that runs diagonally across the grid is continued into the previously black (empty) spaces in the output grid. This consistent pattern across all examples confirms that the rule involves filling in the diagonal lines."
305,c444b776,5,"For the first image:
5. To make the output, you have to...copy the color in one section to any other section.
Explanation: In this image, the colors that are present in the bottom and left sections of the input grid are copied into the corresponding sections of the output grid. There is an additional set of colored squares that are directly copied to make the output grid match the input grid in terms of color and position.

For the second image:
5. To make the output, you have to...copy the color in one section to any other section.
Explanation: Similarly in this image, the colors that are present in the top and right sections of the input grid are copied into the corresponding sections of the output grid. The colored squares presented in those sections are directly mirrored to create the output grid. The rule applied is again copying the color from one section to another."
306,c59eb873,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...divide each block into a 2x2 square in the same color as the original block. So, each block from the original input grid will become a 2x2 block of 4 squares of the same color as the original block.

Explanation: Looking at the three sets of images provided, we can see that each block of color in the input grid (a 1x1 square) is transformed into a larger 2x2 block of the same color in the output grid. For example, the first image set shows a red 1x1 square becoming a 2x2 square of red, a blue 1x1 square becoming a 2x2 square of blue, and so on for the other colors (green and gray). This pattern holds true across all the example image sets provided. There is no change in color, no increase to a 3x3 or 4x4 square, and no randomness in color selection. Therefore, option 5 is the correct answer."
307,c8cbb738,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...place all the groups of pixels on top of each other keeping all colors the same. Leave any left over blocks the color of the original background.

Explanation: In each of the images provided, the transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves condensing the different colored blocks into a smaller grid while maintaining their original colors and positions relative to each other. Any leftover blocks that do not have colored blocks placed on top of them remain the color of the original background. For instance, in the first image, four green squares remain green, and the rest of the grid takes on the blue color of the initial background. This pattern is consistent across all three image examples and aligns with option 3."
308,c8f0f002,2,"The correct option is: 2. To make the output, you have to...change the orange pixels into grey one.

Explanation: In each image, the transformation from the input grid to the output grid is consistent ??all the orange pixels in the input grid are changed to grey in the output grid. All other colors remain unchanged. This rule consistently applies to all three sets of grids provided, confirming option 2 as the correct answer."
309,c909285e,2,"I'm sorry, I cannot provide assistance as there is no content to display for the options provided."
310,c9e6f938,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...make the pattern mirror as left-right with the same height and twice the row.

Explanation: In each of the given examples, the output grid is a left-right mirror image of the input grid, and the colored cells that were in a single row in the input grid are now spread out into two rows in the output grid. The height of the grid remains the same, but the number of rows with colored cells is doubled."
311,c9f8e694,5,"The correct option for the given image files is number 3. 

Explanation: In both images, we observe that the output grid has colored blocks that mirror the pattern of the corresponding horizontal colors from the input grid, but the pattern is applied vertically in the output grid. For instance, in the first image, the third column from the left has alternating yellow and green colors, resembling the pattern in the third row from the top in the input grid. Similarly, in the second image, the pattern of alternating red and blue in the third column from the right matches the third row from the top in the input grid. Therefore, the rule is to color the vertical rectangles in the same pattern as the horizontal colors from the input grid."
312,caa06a1f,5,"The correct answer is: 

5. To make the output, you have to...duplicate the entire grid, then fill in the solid color to exactly match the checker pattern. Finally result should be entirely checker patterned.

Explanation: When examining the provided images, we see that in each instance the pattern on the right (output) grid is a complete checker pattern that precisely mirrors the checker pattern of the input grid on the left. The output grid duplicates the input grid, then fills in the missing colors to complete the checker pattern, resulting in a grid that is fully checker patterned. This rule holds true for all three given image examples, thus option 5 is the correct answer."
313,cbded52d,5,"3. To make the output, you have to...make each vertical and horizontal row identical, altering the middle block in each row to the end blocks.

Explanation: On observing the input and output grids in the given images, it is clear that the pattern in the output grid has been altered in such a way that each vertical and horizontal row is made identical. The middle block in each row has been changed to match the color of the blocks at both ends in that row. This rule is consistent across all the examples provided."
314,cce03e0d,5,"1. Explanation: In the examples provided, the output grid is considered to be divided into eight 4x4 blocks. Each red square in the input grid corresponds to the location of one of these blocks on the output grid. The pattern within the 4x4 area of the input grid is replicated in the 4x4 blocks of the output grid that are indicated by the red squares. For instance, in the first example, the top-left quadrant pattern in the input is copied to the top-right block of the output grid because that's where the red square is located in the input. This pattern continues for each red square present in the input grid."
315,cdecee7f,1,"The correct option is: 

1. To make the output, you have to...follow the input grid colored squares from left to right. The left most color will be in the top left. The next colored square will to go to the right. Each colored square will get its own square in the output. Continue this until you reach the top right corner of the output grid size. Then the next colored square will go under the top right and then they will fill in output grid to the left until it reaches the left edge. Then the it will go below that and continue to the right again. Do this until all of the colored squares from the input grid are used. The remaining squares in the output grid will be black.

Explanation: By examining the images, the colored blocks from the input grid are placed in the output grid starting from left to right, and wrapping down in a zigzag pattern. After placing all the colored blocks from the input grid, the remaining blocks in the output grid remain black. This is consistent across all three images provided."
316,ce22a75a,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...change every gray square and the 9 squares around it into blue.

Explanation: In both images, there are gray squares in the input grid, and in the corresponding output grid, not only have those gray squares changed to blue, but also the squares directly surrounding them in a 3x3 area have changed to blue. This indicates that the rule involves changing the identified gray square and the 9 squares around it (including the gray square itself) to blue."
317,ce4f8723,5,"The correct option is: 5. To make the output, you have to...consider the long input as two sections as 4x4 grids, consider that the two sections as one...then the leave that black spaces as black then point the colored blocks as green.

Explanation: In the given images, the input grid is divided into two sections, each section being a 4x4 grid. In the output grid, these two sections are merged into one 4x4 grid. The black spaces from the input grid remain black in the output grid, while all the other colored blocks are changed to green in the output grid. This rule applies to both the long and short input grids in the provided images."
318,ce602527,5,"The correct option is 5.

Explanation: In each instance, two out of the three colored shapes from the input grid are mirrored onto the output grid with their respective colors. The third shape is not included in the output grid. This pattern is consistent across all four image examples provided."
319,ce9e57f2,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...change the lower half of the red bars to light blue and the upper half remain red. If there are an even number of squares in the bar, the red squares and light blue squares should be even. If there are an odd number of squares in a bar, there should be one more upper red squares than there are lower blue squares.

Explanation: In each of the given image files, we can see that the bars that were originally completely red in the input grid have been partly changed to light blue in the output grid. Specifically, the lower half of each red bar has been changed to light blue, while the upper half of the bar remains red. When looking closely at the number of squares, if a red bar is composed of an even number, the output seems to have been divided precisely in half, with an equal number of red and light blue squares. If a red bar has an odd number of filled squares, then there is one more square remaining red in the upper half than there are light blue squares in the lower half. This matches the rule described in option 3."
320,cf98881b,2,"The correct option is 3. To make the output, you have to...copy the brown pattern first, then overlay the yellow pattern over that, finally overlay the blue pattern over that as well. The yellow pattern will be most visible.

Explanation: In each of the given images, we can observe that the brown squares from the input are always present in the output. They seem to be the base layer. Next, the yellow squares from the input are placed on top, covering any blue or black squares that could be beneath them. Finally, the blue squares from the input are placed on top, but only in spots where there were no yellow squares to cover them. Thus, the yellow pattern has the highest visibility in the output grid, followed by blue, and then brown. Black squares from the input do not appear in the output, which indicates that they are the lowest layer, covered by all other colors."
321,d037b0a7,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...wherever you see a color other than black make squares below that color the same color down to the border.

Explanation: Upon examining the images, we see that the rule being applied involves transforming the colors of the squares that are positioned directly below any colored square that is not black (the base color of the grid). In each case, the colored square and the squares directly below it (to the border of the grid) are changed to match the color of the non-black square, vertically filling that column down to the border. This rule applies consistently across all three provided examples."
322,d06dbe63,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...use just grey blocks add blocks to the top of the blue box, add two up, and then two to the right. Below the blue box add grey blocks, two down and then two to the left. Repeat this pattern to the edge of the grid.

Explanation: By observing both images, we can see a single blue block in the input grid, and in the output grid, there are additional grey blocks placed in a specific pattern around that blue block. The blocks are added in a staircase-like pattern both above and below the blue block?”two up and two right, then two down and two left, respectively, from the blue block's position. This pattern of grey blocks is repeated until reaching the edge of the grid, creating the output shown in the second grid of each image."
323,d07ae81c,4,"The correct option is: 4. To make the output, you have to...draw from single square to diagonal out. For the new lines, make sure to keep the same color on background that is there before.

Explanation:
In the provided images, we can see that there is a pattern where a single square is starting point and from there, diagonal lines are drawn outwards. It's important to note that the color of the squares in the diagonals matches the background color of the square from where the line starts. In the first image, the single red square in a blue section has red diagonal squares leading out to the edge of the grid. Similarly, in the second image, the single light blue square in a pink section has light blue diagonal squares leading out to the edge of the grid. Lastly, in the third image, the single yellow square in a red section has yellow diagonal squares leading out to the edge of the grid. Thus, the rule that is followed is to draw diagonals from the single differently colored square, and ensure that the new diagonal line squares match the background color of the starting square."
324,d0f5fe59,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...take the same color as the shapes in the input grid and create a line from the top left corner to the base right corner.

Explanation: In all three images, the output grid has a diagonal line of blue squares that extends from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. This line mirrors the color and positioning of the individual blue squares in the input grid, suggesting that the rule for creating the output is to form a diagonal line using the same color as the shapes in the input grid. The line should start from the top left corner of the grid and span to the bottom right corner, creating a consistent pattern across all provided examples."
325,d10ecb37,5,"1. To make the output, you have to...copy the colors used in the bottom right corner of four squares of the grid and make them the corresponding colors on the output 2x2 grid.

Explanation: In each of the given images, the output 2x2 grid colors correspond to the colors found in the bottom right corner of the four squares that make up the 2x2 section of the input grid. For example, in the first image, the bottom right corner of the four squares on the input grid are red, yellow, grey, and red, which are then replicated on the output grid. Similarly, in the second image, the bottom right corner of the input grid has green, blue, red, and yellow, which correspond to the output grid. In the third image, the bottom right corners are green, black, yellow, and pink, which match the output."
326,d13f3404,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...repeat the pattern from the original corner to the other corner of the new bigger grid.

Explanation: In each of the three examples provided, the pattern present in the initial grid is being duplicated diagonally across the larger grid. Starting in the top left corner of the input grid, the colors and arrangement are mirrored to fill the output grid, expanding towards the bottom right corner. This rule consistently applies, duplicating the input pattern across the grid until it is completely filled. The rule matches option 4, as the replication occurs from one corner to the opposite corner of the output grid."
327,d22278a0,5,"The correct option is: 1. To make the output, you have to...draw checkerboard patterns from the corner, without crossing the middle horizontal or vertical to the same color.

Explanation: In each input grid, a square in one corner is a different color from the rest of the grid. In the corresponding output grid, this square expands to a checkerboard pattern. The pattern consists of alternating colors in a diagonal manner starting from the corner where the initial colored square was located. The pattern does not extend past the midline horizontally or vertically, maintaining the same-colored squares without crossing the center lines."
328,d23f8c26,2,"2. To make the output, you have to...turn everything black, but keep the middle vertical line of colored squares.

Explanation: In each image provided, we can observe that the output grid on the right retains a vertical line of colored squares directly from the center of the input grid on the left. All other squares in the input grid have been turned black. The rule that's been applied consistently across all images is to preserve only the middle vertical line of colored squares while turning the rest of the grid black. This rule aligns with option 2."
329,d2abd087,3,"The correct option is:

3. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid. Then count how many gray squares make up each of the individual shapes. If the shape uses (6) gray squares, change those gray squares to red. If the shape has any other number of gray squares, change the gray squares to blue.

Explanation:
In the given images, there are shapes made up of gray squares. Upon counting the number of gray squares in each individual shape in the input grids, it is observed that when a shape consists of exactly six gray squares, that shape is changed to red in the output grid. All other shapes, regardless of the number of gray squares that make them up, are changed to blue in the output grid. There are no green squares or yellow color changes present in the grids, which rules out options 4 and 5, and the number of gray squares that trigger the red color change is specifically six, which rules out options 1 and 2. Therefore, option 3 is the correct answer."
330,d364b489,1,"The correct answer is: 2. Explanation: In both images, we can observe that each blue square on the input grid has corresponding colored squares on each of its sides in the output grid. Specifically, an orange square is placed to the right of any blue square, a red square is placed below the blue square, a purple square is placed on the left of the blue square, and a light blue square is placed above the blue square. This consistent pattern matches the description provided in option 2. None of the other options accurately describe the transformation seen in the images."
331,d406998b,3,"The correct answer is 3. To make the output, you have to...begin from the right-most column and change the grey pixels in the odd-numbered columns with green.

Explanation: By examining the images, we can see that only the grey pixels in the odd-numbered columns (1st, 3rd, 5th, etc.) have been changed to green in the output grid. The even-numbered columns remain unchanged, and the change starts from the right-most column of the grid moving to the left. Thus, option 3 accurately describes the rule for creating the output grid from the input grid."
332,d43fd935,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...fill the same color of any square that is vertical or horizontal to the corner of the green square.

Explanation: Observing the input and output grids in all three images, the rule that consistently applies is the filling of the same color squares that are in a line, either vertically or horizontally, starting from the corners of the green square present in the input grid. The green squares in input are always transformed into lines of filled squares in the output, extending in all directions from its corners without any change in color."
333,d4469b4b,1,"The correct option is: 

1. To make the output, you have to...make a 3x3 grid. If the input grid has blue shapes, the output should be light grey with black in the four corners (making a grey plus sign). If the input grid has red shapes, the output should be light grey with black on the lower left, middle left, middle right and lower right (making a grey T shape). If the input grid has green shapes, the output should be light grey with black in the upper left, middle left, upper center and middle center (making a 2x2 black square in the upper left).

Explanation: Across all the provided images, the output seems to convert the input into a 3x3 grid regardless of the input grid size. Secondarily, the colored shapes in the input appear to determine the placement of the black squares in the output grid. 

- For input grids with red shapes, black squares form a T shape.
- For input grids with blue shapes, black squares form a plus shape.
- For input grids with green shapes, black squares form a 2x2 square in the upper left.

All other choices are inconsistent with the observed patterns."
334,d4a91cb9,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...draw a down line with yellow to which the red grid's row meet. and continue the yellow grid to the side of the red grid.

Explanation: In each of the provided images, we see a small red and blue square in the input grid. In the output grid, a yellow line is drawn starting from the row in which the red square is situated and continues downward until it meets the edge of the grid. This yellow line then continues to the right from the position of the red square, forming an ""L"" shape. The blue square's original position is maintained at the top of the yellow line. Therefore, the rule being followed is to draw a down line with yellow starting at the red square's row and continuing the yellow line to the right, forming an ""L"" shape."
335,d4f3cd78,1,"1, Explanation: In both provided images, the common rule observed is to fill the gray areas of the input grid with a light blue color in the output grid. Additionally, a line of the same light blue color is extended outward from the bottom of the filled area to the edge of the grid, creating a T-shape in the first image and an inverted L-shape in the second image. This rule fits the description provided in the first option. The other options either suggest different colors (yellow, red, brown, pink) which are not present in the transformed grids or refer to shapes (shortening a line, extending to the top or side end of the grid) that do not match the transformations seen in the images."
336,d511f180,3,"The correct answer is option 3.

3, Explanation: Upon inspecting the images, it can be observed that the only change from the input grid to the output grid is the swapping of light blue and gray squares. All the other colored squares remain in the same position with the same color. This rule applies consistently across all three given image examples. Therefore, the rule to create the output grid from the input grid is to change all gray squares to light blue and all light blue squares to gray, while keeping everything else the same as in the input."
337,d5d6de2d,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...fill in the holes of the boxes with green, then black out the outlines of the boxes.

Explanation: By observing the provided images, the common rule in each set is that the areas in the input that form enclosed spaces (holes) within the red outline are filled with green in the output, and the remaining parts, including the red outline itself, are turned black. This rule is consistently applied across all three examples, hence option 5 correctly describes the transformation process."
338,d631b094,2,"The correct option is: 

2. To make the output, you have to...color the whole output grid the color of the colored input grid blocks so there is a horizontal line of colored blocks.

Explanation:

For each input grid, the output grid has been filled with the color present in the input grid. In the input grid, regardless of the arrangement of the colored blocks, they form a line horizontally. The output grid reflects this rule by showing a solid block of color that matches the input grid color, giving the appearance of a horizontal line when considering the line the colored blocks formed in the input grid."
339,d687bc17,3,"The correct option is 4. 

Explanation: 
Upon examining the images provided and the rules given, Option 4 is the one that accurately describes the transformation from the input grid to the output grid. The consistent feature is that coloured blocks that match the colour of one side edge of the grid are moved towards that edge until they touch it. Any remaining blocks in the middle of the same colour are coloured green. In all examples, coloured blocks touching any side are not present in the output grid; instead, they are replaced with green blocks in their previous central positions, confirming that the correct answer is Option 4."
340,d6ad076f,2,"2. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid and connect the two shapes with the blue grid. It must be smaller than the size of the small input shape.

Explanation: Observing all three sets of input grids and their corresponding output grids, it appears that the two distinct colored shapes from the input grid are connected with a blue grid in the output grid. Moreover, the size of this connecting blue grid is smaller in size as compared to the smaller of the two colored shapes in the input grid. This rule is consistent across all three given examples."
341,d89b689b,2,"The correct option is: 

2. To make the output, you have to...replace 2x2 same grid color with all other four different colors that in input grid. each 2x2 grid color are different in output grid 2x2.

Explanation: In each example provided, the output image consists of a 2x2 grid with four different colored squares. These colors are the same as the four different colors presented in the input grid, but none of the 2x2 output grid colors repeat, they are all unique. This indicates that the rule is to identify the four different colors in the input grid, and then create a 2x2 grid in the output that contains each of the colors once, without repeating any color."
342,d8c310e9,5,"For the given images, the correct answer is:

5. To make the output, you have to...connect the repeating pattern continuously to the right end.

Explanation: In all the images, the input grid shows a repeating pattern of colored blocks that are disrupted by black blocks. To generate the output grid from the input grid, the rule is to continue the interrupted pattern of colored blocks as though the black blocks do not exist, effectively making a seamless repeating pattern that extends continuously to the right end of the grid. This is evident as we see the pattern reconnected and extended in the output grid in all the examples provided."
343,d90796e8,3,"The correct answer choice is number 1, based on the presented information, the explanation would be:

1. Explanation: In the input image, the green cell is located between the two gray cells. In the output image, the same green cell is placed between a gray and a blue cell. The input image is no longer necessary, as it has been replaced by the output image."
344,d9f24cd1,4,"2. To make the output, you have to...extend each grey dot straight up so it forms a vertical line. The grey pixel must change direction as it reaches the red pixel to the right and continue straight up.

Explanation: In the given images, we can see that the grey squares in the input grid are extended vertically upwards in the output grid until they intersect with a red square. Upon reaching a red square, the vertical grey line is shifted horizontally to the right and continues upwards. This matches the description in option 2, where it is specified that grey dots must be extended upwards and change direction when encountering a red pixel. The other options do not match the colors and behaviors observed in the images."
345,d9fac9be,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...zoom into the different colored center block from the input grid and make it the only colored block.

Explanation: In each input grid, there is a block in the center that has a different color from the others surrounding it. In the output grid, this center block is enlarged to fill the entire grid, and it is the only block that retains its color as all other blocks are not visible. This rule applies consistently across all the provided images."
346,dae9d2b5,1,"1. Explanation: The rule to create the output grid from the input grid in each given image involves replicating the pattern from the left side of the input grid (which contains yellow squares) to the output grid first. Then, the green pattern from the input grid is overlaid, but since these images are presented in black and white, ""green"" corresponds to the lighter shaded squares that are not yellow (which appear as white in the images due to lack of color). Finally, all the yellow and green (light) squares are recolored to pink, resulting in an output grid with pink and black squares only. The other options are not applicable because there are no red, blue, light blue, or grey squares in the given black and white images."
347,db3e9e38,5,"1, Explanation: The rule to create the output grid from the input grid is to clone the input and start from the center, changing colors between brown and red, and decreasing the line by two blocks. The output grid has a line of brown (which may look like orange in the given images) in the middle, then a line of red on both sides, followed by another line of brown and a final line of red on the outermost part. It fits the description for option 1, despite the apparent error in referring to the colors as brown and red instead of orange and light blue, which are the actual colors in the image. There seems to be a discrepancy in the color descriptions provided in the options."
348,db93a21d,4,"4, Explanation: The input grids contain red squares of various sizes placed in different locations on the grid. In the output grids, we observe the following pattern consistently applied:

1. Each red square from the input grid is bordered with a green border in the output grid. The border is half the width of the red square's size. For example, if a red square is 4 units wide, the green border is 2 units wide.

2. Below each red (and green-bordered) square, a vertical line of blue squares fills the space from the bottom of the green border to the bottom of the grid. The line of blue squares is as wide as the red square is.

Therefore, the rule that creates the output grid from the input grid for each given image is option 4: ""To make the output, you have to... put a green border around each red square. The thickness of the green border should equal one half of the thickness of the red square (if the square is 6 squares across then the green border should be three squares deep around it). Fill the black squares below the red and green squares with a vertical line of blue squares. The blue squares should be in the same vertical row as the red square and should be the same width as the red square. If the blue line should intersect with a green box, then the green box should stay. Don't color over any green."""
349,dbc1a6ce,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...check the blue grid which is at the same row and same line. draw a connected light blue grid between the blue grid at the same row and line.

Explanation: Upon examining the images, it is clear that the output grid is produced by drawing a connected light blue grid between the blue squares that are on the same row. There is no change in the column position, and the connecting grid is light blue, not any other color mentioned in the options. The rule applies consistently across all the given examples, confirming that option 5 is the correct choice."
350,dc0a314f,3,"The correct option is: 

1. To make the output, you have to...identify the diagonal symmetry pattern in the input grid, and appropriately fill in the regions obscured by the green square to complete the diagonal symmetry pattern. Only represent the green square portion in the output grid.

Explanation: In all the given image files, we can see that the output grid represents a portion of the input grid with a diagonal symmetry pattern. The output grid reflects the colors from the opposite diagonal half of the input grid, indicating a mirror image along the diagonal. The green square portion is used as a reference to identify which part of the input grid should be represented in the output grid, based on the diagonal symmetry rule."
351,dc1df850,5,"The correct option is: 

5. To make the output, you have to...surround only the red squares with a blue border that is one square wide.

Explanation: In each output grid, we can observe that the red squares from the input grid are being surrounded by a blue border that is one square wide. We can see this in the first image where the single red square is surrounded by blue squares to its immediate left, right, top, and bottom. Similarly, in the second and third images, the red squares are surrounded in like manner. Other colored squares in the input grid are left unchanged in the respective positions in the output grid. Therefore, the common rule across all three images is to surround only the red squares with a blue border that is one square wide."
352,dc433765,2,"2. To make the output, you have to...move the green square one block closer to the yellow square, no matter if it is horizontal, diagonal, or vertical.

Explanation: In each pair of images provided, the green square has moved one block in the direction of the yellow square, closing the gap between them by one block each time. This is consistent across all the examples given, irrespective of whether the squares are placed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally relative to each other. The other options mention different colors which are not present in the images, and option 3 suggests moving the yellow square instead of the green one, which does not match the observed pattern."
353,ddf7fa4f,2,"3. To make the output, you have to...fill the black area with the colors corresponding with the colored block in the first row.

Explanation: By examining the images, we can see that the gray blocks in the input grid are not altered, maintaining their gray color in the output grid. The colored blocks in the first row of the input grid determine the color for the corresponding area in the output grid. The black blocks in the input grid become colored in the output grid, following the color of the block directly above in the first row. For example, in the third image, the blue block in the first row corresponds to the blue area in the output grid, and the yellow block in the first row corresponds to the yellow area in the output grid."
354,de1cd16c,2,"The correct option is:

2. To make the output, you have to...look for the colored grid with the largest number of colored squares and use that color.

Explanation:

By looking at the given images, we can see that the output grid takes the color of the largest contiguous area of color in the input grid. For example:

- In the first image, the input grid has the largest contiguous area in blue, so the output grid is blue.
- In the second image, the largest contiguous area is yellow, so the output is yellow.
- In the third image, the largest contiguous area is pink, so the output is pink.
- In the fourth image, the largest contiguous area is red, so the output is red.

This rule consistently applies to all the given images. Hence, the most appropriate option is the second one, as it captures the observed pattern of selecting the color with the largest area in the input grid to fill the output grid."
355,ded97339,3,"4. To make the output, you have to...connect the blue boxes that are directly vertical and horizontal to each other.

Explanation: In each of the given images, the input grid features individual blue boxes placed at various positions. The output grid shows that these blue boxes have been connected with each other either vertically or horizontally to form a continuous line or shape. There are no connections made on a diagonal basis, and the rule remains consistent across all three examples. Therefore, option 4 is correct."
356,e179c5f4,1,"1. To make the output, you have to...add the same color blue pixel in a zig-zag pattern moving up the grid. Each pixel should be filled in on a diagonal going up and to the right until you reach the edge of the grid. Then you should keep moving on the diagonal up and to the left until you reach the left side of the grid. Keep repeating until you reach the top of the grid. Then fill in the rest of the spaces with the light blue color.

Explanation: This is the correct answer based on the image provided. In the output grid, we can see a dark blue pixel that zig-zags its way from the bottom to the top in a diagonal manner. It begins by moving up and to the right until it hits the edge of the grid, then continues moving up and to the left until it hits the left edge of the grid. This pattern is repeated until the dark blue pixel reaches the top of the grid. All other spaces are filled with the light blue color, matching the pattern and colors seen in the output grid of the image."
357,e21d9049,2,"The correct answer is 2. To make the output, you have to...continue the lines to all edges, using alternating the color pattern.

Explanation: In both examples provided, the output grid shows lines that extend outwards from the input pattern towards the edges of the grid. Each line follows an alternating color pattern from its starting point until it reaches the edge of the grid. In the first example, the yellow, blue, green, and red blocks are extended in the form of lines that reach the edges, alternating colors as they go. In the second example, the blue, green, and red blocks are similarly extended towards the edges in the form of alternating colored lines. No lines are broken at any edge, and no lines are stopped before the edges, which eliminates options 1 and 5. Additionally, the lines do not go to the corners (eliminating option 3), and the color pattern used is alternating, not the same (eliminating option 4). The consistent rule across both examples is extending the lines with an alternating color pattern to all edges, making option 2 the correct answer."
358,e26a3af2,2,"The correct answer is: 2. To make the output, you have to...eliminate all the random color squares and replace them with the color of the bar they are in.

Explanation: In each image, the output grid has been created by taking the input grid and replacing all squares that are not part of the main color bars with the color of the bar they are in. In other words, all the randomly colored squares within each colored bar (red, green, blue, orange, etc.) in the input grid are replaced with the color of that bar to create a uniform bar of color in the output grid."
359,e3497940,3,"1. To make the output, you have to...fill in the blocks as if you have flipped the top side directly over the bottom side, taking the gray line out. The blocks directly below the gray line will overlap.

Explanation: In all three images, the colored blocks above the gray line are duplicated below the gray line in the output grid, with the gray line removed. The overlapping blocks maintain their original colors, which indicates that a flip has occurred along the gray line, with the top flipping over to the bottom. There is no rotation or mirroring involved, as the position of the colors in relation to each other remains unchanged, and there is no left or right folding because the colors do not appear distorted or twisted."
360,e40b9e2f,3,"1. To make the output, you have to...move the outside colors to the opposite sides, and make square patterns with it. Rotate the inside shape counterclockwise 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, and fill in all of these at once on the grid.

Explanation: In each of the three example images, the output grid follows the same transformation rules. The colored squares that are on the edge of the inner shape in the input grid are moved to the opposite side of the grid to form a square pattern in the output grid. Then, the inner shape is rotated counterclockwise by 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees and all these rotated shapes are overlaid on top of each other in the grid to create the final pattern. This can be confirmed by looking at the orientation and position of the shapes in the output grid compared to the input grid."
361,e48d4e1a,4,"3. To make the output, you have to...count the grey grid and place the intersection point of the colored grid-right with the same count.

Explanation: In each of the input grids, there is a grey square positioned at a certain point along the vertical colored line. In the output grids, the colored line has been shifted to the right while maintaining its vertical orientation, and the intersection point where the grey square was located is preserved in the same position relative to the colored line, now placed horizontally at the bottom. The number of colored squares remains the same, and their position is adjusted so that the intersection point aligns with where the grey square originally was on the vertical axis. The count of the colored squares doesn't change; it's the position that shifts from a vertical to a horizontal orientation at the specified intersection point."
362,e5062a87,2,"The correct option is 2.

Explanation: In the given images, the output grid is produced by identifying any black squares that match the pattern created by the red squares in the input grid and then changing those black squares to red in the output grid. Upon close examination, it is evident that the pattern of the red squares determines which black squares will be changed to red in the resulting grid. This rule is consistent across all three sets of images provided. Thus, the correct answer is option 2, ""To make the output, you have to...find any black squares that are in the same pattern as the red squares, then change the black squares in each pattern to red."""
363,e509e548,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...change pattern color to blue if the pattern only has one 90 degree edge, pink if it has two and red if it has three. also if it shape is a 1 it is red, a c it is pink and an L it is blue.

Explanation: Upon examining the given images, it is clear that the output is determined by the number of 90 degree edges the patterns have and the specific shape representing a letter or number. For instance, the green pattern is transformed into a blue pattern because it only has one 90 degree edge. The pattern that resembles the number 1 is changed to red. Similarly, the patterns with two 90 degree edges are colored pink, and those with three 90 degree edges are colored red. Additionally, a c-shape is colored pink, and an L-shape is colored blue in the output. Therefore, option 4 is the correct answer as it matches the transformation observed in the images."
364,e50d258f,1,"The correct option for these images is: 

1. To make the output, you have to...copy the rectangular shape with the most red squares exactly.

Explanation: In all three provided examples, the output grid highlights a rectangular region from the input grid. This region contains the most red squares compared to any other region of the same size within the input grid, and it has been copied over exactly to create the output grid. The positioning of the red squares within the region, as well as the blue squares, matches precisely between the input and the output, confirming that this is the consistent rule across all the examples."
365,e6721834,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...change the output grid to the background color that does not include the two boxes. Next place the colored boxes on the grid where the interior colored boxes match.

Explanation: In all the given images, the output grid has changed the background color to one that does not feature among the colored boxes in the input grid. Upon closer examination, it can be seen that the colored boxes are placed in the output grid in the same spatial arrangement as in the input grid and the colors within those boxes match as well. This means that the rule that applies to creating the output grid from the input grid involves changing the background color and then copying over the colored boxes with their respective colors in the same positions."
366,e73095fd,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...fill the nodes with yellow.

Explanation: In each of the given images, the output grid has the intersection points or 'nodes' where the gray lines meet filled with yellow color. This rule is consistent across all the examples provided, with the gray lines maintained while the nodes change from being empty to being filled with yellow."
367,e76a88a6,5,"The correct option for both images is:

5. To make the output, you have to...copy the color pattern into the other gray grids.

Explanation: Upon examining the images, it is clear that the pattern formed by the colored squares in the input grid is replicated (or copied) onto the gray squares in the output grid. The initial pattern is not removed or erased; it remains intact. Thus, the rule applied to create the output grid from the input grid requires copying the existing color pattern onto the gray squares present in the grid. Options 1, 2, 3, and 4 do not accurately describe the transformation observed in the images."
368,e8593010,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...change the single black pixels to green, two black pixel lines to red, and three black pixel shapes to blue. The background stays gray.

Explanation: For all the given image examples, the transformation rule that consistently applies is that single black squares in the input have been changed to green in the output, lines made of two adjacent black squares have been changed to red, and shapes made of three black squares have been changed to blue. All other squares that are gray in the input remain gray in the background of the output. This rule aligns with option 4."
369,e8dc4411,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...without any change in the colors of any patterns, shapes, size and the background, copy the pattern on the black colored grids, to the other grid which is not patterned thus replicating it with the pattern and size of the black grid, continue to add the same pattern diagonally towards the only edge of the grid.

Explanation: Across all three given images, the transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves copying the black patterned shape to the other side of the grid and adding additional black squares diagonally towards the nearest edge without changing the color or size of the original pattern. This rule applies consistently in each image and none of the other options describe this process accurately. The newly added black squares follow a diagonal line that extends the original shape towards the edge. The rest of the grid remains unaltered, maintaining the original blue or yellow background color."
370,e9614598,1,"1, Explanation: In both image examples, a 3x3 green cross pattern is created perfectly centered between two blue squares in the input grid, resulting in the output grid. The position of the blue squares may vary, but the rule remains the same ??to form a 3x3 green cross equidistant from both blue squares. The three-squares scenario in option 5 doesn't apply here as we only have two blue squares in the input. Other options mention either different shapes (such as a 2x2 cross or a 3x3 square), or a different color (red), which are not consistent with the patterns observed in the given images."
371,e98196ab,5,"4. To make the output, you have to...separate both patterns from above and below the gray line.

Explanation: In all the given image files, the constant element is the gray horizontal line that runs through the center of the grid. The colored blocks above and below this gray line seem to define the rule. In the output grid, it appears that the pattern of colored blocks below the gray line is retained in the same sequential order, while the pattern of colored blocks above the gray line is moved to follow after the blocks below. Essentially, the output is created by dividing the input grid at the gray line and placing the upper pattern after the lower one in the output grid, maintaining their respective left-to-right order."
372,e9afcf9a,4,"1. To make the output, you have to... start with the color that is on the left. Fill in that line with that color every other square, beginning with the first square. Fill in the rest in that line with the sixth color. For the next line, start with the color that is already there (the sixth color) and fill in in the same every other square pattern. It should look like a game board. The first color in every line is the color of the input grid.

Explanation: From the given images, we can see the output is a pattern that alternates every other square, starting with the color on the left for the first row, and then using the sixth color (the second color from the left in the input grid) for the alternating squares. On the second row, the pattern begins with the sixth color and alternates with the starting color, creating a ""game board"" pattern. This rule accurately describes how to create the output from the input grid for the provided images."
373,ea32f347,5,"The correct answer is: 3. To make the output, you have to...change the color of the lines. The shortest line needs to be colored blue. The middle length line needs to be colored yellow. The longest line needs to be colored red.

Explanation: By looking at the provided images, we can see that each output grid retains the same number and placement of lines as the input grid, but the colors of the lines have been changed. In each case, the shortest line is now blue, the line of medium length is yellow, and the longest line is red. This consistent pattern across all images indicates that the rule for creating the output grid from the input grid is to recolor the lines based on their length following this specific color scheme."
374,ea786f4a,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...create an X by filling in the diagonal tiles until the edge of each corner is reached.

Explanation: In each given image, the transformation from the input grid to the output grid involves filling in the diagonal tiles to form an X shape that extends from corner to corner, leaving a triangle of the original color in each corner. Option 3 accurately describes this rule. No other described patterns (such as vertical, horizontal, or Z shapes) match the change observed in the images."
375,eb281b96,5,"1. To make the output, you have to...remove the grid. Then paste the augmented pattern onto the output grid. Next, create a mirror pattern from the modified pattern underneath the existing pattern. Then transfer the whole modernized and mirrored arrangement to fill in the rest of the white grid.

Explanation: Looking at the provided images, the output appears to follow a rule where the existing black and colored checkered pattern from the input grid is maintained and repeated to fill the entire output grid. This is done by creating a mirror image of the pattern underneath the existing pattern and then copying the entire arrangement to fill the rest of the grid, effectively doubling the size of the pattern both horizontally and vertically. This results in an output grid that is a larger, checkered pattern of alternating colored and black squares. Option 1 most accurately describes this process."
376,eb5a1d5d,1,"The correct answer is: 

1. To make the output, you have to...put the center box color in 1x1, the outside box color in 3x3, then 5x5, then 7x7 and so on.

Explanation: In each example, the output grid follows a pattern where the color of the center square is placed in a 1x1 area in the center of the output grid. This color then alternates every two layers with the color that is in the outermost box of the input grid. In larger grids, the pattern would continue to expand outward in the same manner. For example, the 9x9 area would be filled with the center box color, the 11x11 with the outside box color, and so forth. This pattern is consistent across all the provided images."
377,ec883f72,3,"The correct answer is option 2, ""To make the output, you have to... remove vertical lines from each corner of the outer squares towards the center of the output grid.""

Explanation: From the given image comparisons, it is clear that squares which are positioned vertically from each corner towards the center of the input grid are removed in the output grid, creating a gap in place of those squares. It can be observed that only the vertical arrangement of squares (from the corners towards the center) are affected, and this pattern of removal is consistent across all the given examples. Horizontal squares and other positions are left unchanged, which eliminates the other options that suggest the addition or manipulation of diagonal or horizontal lines."
378,ecdecbb3,4,"4. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid. Make perpendicular lines from the dots of y color to touch the closest lines of x color. The point of touch should be the y color. If the dot of y color is between 2 lines of y color you should make one lines of y color going through the dot of y color and connecting the lines of x colors. Surround each dot of y color (point of touch) on the line of x color with a square of x color. It should be a square of x color with the center of y color on the line of x color. Done.

Explanation: By examining the transformation of the input grid to the output grid, we can see that there are perpendicular lines extending from red squares to the nearest blue lines. The points where the red lines meet the blue lines are coloured red. Additionally, when a red square is positioned between two parallel blue lines, a red line is drawn connecting the blue lines and passing through the red square. Finally, the intersections marked by red squares on the blue lines are surrounded by a blue square with a red center. This matches the description given in option number 4."
379,ed36ccf7,3,"The correct option is:

4. To make the output, you have to...turn the pattern in the input grid clockwise.

Explanation: In each given image, the pattern in the output grid appears to have been rotated 90 degrees clockwise compared to the input grid. For example, in the first image, the top row in the input grid has pink on the left and black on the right. In the output grid, this pattern is rotated so that the pink is now on the bottom and black is on the top. This clockwise rotation is consistent across all the provided images."
380,ef135b50,1,"1. Explanation: The consistent rule across all three image examples is that the brown squares are placed in the horizontal spaces between the red squares when the red squares are directly across from each other on the left and right sides. The brown squares fill the gap completely between the red squares, creating a bridge of brown squares horizontally. There are no brown circles, green squares, or any ""pull"" action involved in the transformation from the input to the output grid. Hence, option 1 is the correct choice."
381,f15e1fac,2,"The correct answer is 2.

Explanation: By examining the input and output grids, we can see that the blue squares act as a starting point for drawing lines. When the blue squares are on the left side, lines are drawn horizontally to the right, and when the blue squares are at the top, lines are drawn vertically down. The red squares act as a signal to change the direction of the blue lines. In the output grid, if we encounter a red square, we start the next blue line one grid ahead following the position of the red square. The lines stop just before the next red square. The pattern continues with each subsequent line following the same rule where the position of the red square dictates the new starting point until the end of the grid."

383,f25fbde4,4,"The correct option is:

4. To make the output, you have to...double the pattern and fit the resulting pattern to scale. If it's 1x5 the result should be 2x10.

Explanation: In each image, the pattern in the output grid is exactly double the size of the pattern in the input grid, both in terms of the number of yellow squares and the overall scale. For example, in the first image, the input grid has a pattern of 2x3 yellow squares and the output grid has the same pattern doubled to 4x6 yellow squares. The same rule applies to the second and third images, where the patterns are doubled in size while maintaining their original shape and proportion."
384,f25ffba3,1,"The correct option is: 

5. To make the output, you have to...rotate the pattern clockwise like it was up against a fan.

Explanation: In both examples, you can notice that the colored squares in the output grid are the same as in the input grid but have been rotated 90 degrees, or a quarter turn, in the clockwise direction. In the first image, the blue square that was on the bottom left of the input grid moved to the top left of the output grid; similarly, the green square moved from the second-from-the-bottom to the second-from-the-top position. In the second image, the red and green squares followed the same pattern, indicating that the rule applied to the output grid is a clockwise rotation."
385,f2829549,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...combine the orange and grey into one pattern that take up a 4x3 space. Fill each black space with green. Fill the old pattern with black. You should only have green spaces.

Explanation: In the input grid, we see a pattern of orange and gray boxes that take four columns and three rows. We also see black boxes taking up the rest of the space. In the output, the squares that were black in the input grid are now green, and the rest of the grid is black (the area previously containing the orange and gray). This rule matches option 3, where we eliminate the colors orange and gray entirely and replace what was previously black with green in a 4x3 grid. The new pattern has the same layout structure in all images which confirms option 3 as the correct answer."
386,f35d900a,5,"5. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid, identify the colors of the colored grids. we will call it color A and color B. Around the grids with color A, create a 3x3 square with color B, surrounding the color A grids. Around the grids with color B, create a 3x3 square with color A, surrounding the color B grids. Now we should have four 3x3 squares, in which two squares are A color with B colored grid in their centers.

Explanation: In each of the provided images, the transformation from the input grid to the output grid follows the same pattern. Colored squares in the input grid are surrounded by a 3x3 square of the opposite color in the output grid. This creates a pattern of larger squares with a smaller square of the original color in the center. This is consistent with option 5, where 3x3 squares are created around the original colored grids, resulting in larger squares with the original colored square in the center."
387,f5b8619d,4,"The correct option is: 

4. To make the output, you have to...use the input grid as 4 sections of the output so that there is a pattern of the first colored squares, then using light blue make lines up and down from the colored squares to until you reach another colored square or the end of the output grid.

Explanation: In the given images, we can observe that the output grid is larger than the input grid. The colored squares from the input are repeated in four sections to create a larger grid pattern in the output. Additionally, light blue lines are drawn vertically from the colored squares until they intersect with another colored square or reach the top or bottom of the output grid. This pattern is consistent across all three examples provided, confirming that option 4 is the correct rule applied."
388,f76d97a5,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...replace the grey boxes with the color and replace the color boxes with black.

Explanation: In each of the three examples, it is evident that the grey boxes in the input grid are replaced by the color (pink, red, yellow respectively) in the output grid. On the other hand, the colored boxes in the input grid are turned into black in the output grid. The non-grey and non-colored boxes remain unchanged (black remains black). Therefore, option 3 correctly describes the transformation rule for these grids."
389,f8a8fe49,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...flip the grey pattern over the red one like a mirror image. The resulting output should now have the grey pattern outside of the orange one.

Explanation: In the provided images, the grey pattern is mirrored over the vertical axis, swapping its position from the left to the right side of the orange pattern. This mirrored grey pattern is now located on the exterior side of the orange pattern in the output grid. Options 1, 2, 4, and 5 reference colors (blue, yellow, green) and actions (flipping over red, yellow, or green patterns) that are not visible in the images provided, therefore they can be disregarded. The only relevant colors are grey and orange, and the only action correctly describing the transformation is the flipping of the grey pattern over the red one to the outside of the orange one, which corresponds to option 3."
390,f8b3ba0a,1,"5. To make the output, you have to...randomize the color boxes. Use a minimal amount of the color box.

Explanation: In each given image, the output grid appears to condense the input grid's color pattern into a single column, maintaining the order of appearance from top to bottom and selecting only the minimal number of colored boxes necessary to represent the sequence without repetition. The output grid discards any additional instances of a color after it appears once, resulting in a simplified, non-repetitive color pattern."
391,f8c80d96,1,"1. Explanation: Each set of images follows the same rule where the background color changes from black to light gray and the colored pattern is continued with the same spacing and angle as seen in the input grid. The colored lines are extended while maintaining their original spacing and direction, completing the pattern across the entire grid."
392,f8ff0b80,1,"1. Explanation: After examining the images, the common rule appears to be counting the number of pixels composing each colored object in the input grid. The next step is to fill the color of the object with the highest pixel count into the output grid. The output is arranged in a vertical 3x1 structure with the colors stacked from top to bottom, based on the descending order of pixel count (highest to lowest). 

In the first image, the green object has the highest pixel count, followed by red, then blue. In the second image, the orange object has the highest pixel count, followed by blue, then red. In the third image, the yellow object has the highest pixel count, followed by red, then blue. Each output grid reflects this order, showing that the first option is the correct transformation rule."
393,f9012d9b,5,"The correct option is 5.

Explanation: In each of the given images, the pattern consists of a dominant color (blue, pink, or red) and sections of black. The black sections occupy certain parts of the grid. In the output grid, the black portions from the input grid are removed, and the remaining dominant color fills the entire grid. However, the position of the black section in the input is represented by a single section of the dominant color in the output that corresponds to the location of the black section in the input grid. Thus, to make the output grid, you have to fill the black portion of the input grid to correspond to the overall pattern; in the output grid, only represent the filled black part from the input grid."
394,fafffa47,2,"2. To make the output, you have to...create a 3x3 grid and flood fill it with black color. Next, copy the brown pattern to the 3x3 grid. Then, overlap the blue pattern on top of the brown pattern. After that, fill in the black squares with red color and fill in all the brown and blue squares with black color.

Explanation: By examining the input and output grids, we can see that the output is a 3x3 grid, and the initial step involves filling this grid with a base color, which is black. The next step is to identify the brown (which appears maroon or dark red in the input) pattern in the input grid and replicate it onto the 3x3 grid. Then, the blue pattern from the input grid needs to be overlapped onto the already copied brown pattern in the output grid. Finally, the remaining black squares in the output grid are filled with red, and all squares that were part of the brown and blue patterns (now overlapping) are filled with black color, resulting in the final output pattern. This matches with option 2 and its explanation."
395,fcb5c309,5,"The correct option is 5.

Explanation: Upon inspection of the input grids and corresponding output grids for all the three given image files, it can be observed that in each case, the output grid takes the configuration of a rectangle from the input grid that contains the most single (not duplicated) pixels of a secondary color. The single pixels that make up this number are included within the output grid, and the primary color of the rectangle is replaced to match that of the single pixels inside it.

In the first image, the output grid is filled with red, which matches the single red pixels within the selected rectangle in the input grid. Similarly, in the second image, the output grid is filled with yellow, matching the color of the single yellow pixels in the selected rectangle in the input grid. And in the third image, the output grid is filled with green, matching the color of the single green pixels in the selected rectangle in the input grid.

Therefore, option 5 is the rule that best describes the transformation from the input grid to the output grid for all the images provided."
396,fcc82909,3,"3. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid directly into the output grid. Then, for each 2x2 square, check the number of unique colors present. Append 1x2 green pixels below that 2x2 square, equal to the number of distinct colors contained within it.

Explanation: By examining the input and output grid for each image, it is evident that the output grid is a replication of the input grid with additional pixels added. Specifically, beneath each 2x2 square of the input grid, a set of 1x2 green pixels is placed in the output grid. The number of green pixels corresponds to the count of distinct colors within that 2x2 area. In the provided images, any 2x2 square with two unique colors has two green pixels added beneath it, a 2x2 square with three unique colors has three green pixels added, and a 2x2 square with four unique colors has four green pixels added in the output grid. This pattern consistently matches option 3 for all image examples."
397,feca6190,5,"The correct option is: 

1. To make the output, you have to...look at the number and positions of colored pixels in a 5x1 input grid. The output grid is a square with both its height and width equaling five times the number of colored pixels found in the input grid. Replicate the input grid to the bottom-left 5x1 area of the output grid, diverging from the existing colored pixels, stretch every pixel diagonally towards the top-right heading of the output grid until touching the edge.

Explanation: Based on the images, we can identify that the input grid is a 5x1 grid with colored pixels in certain positions. The output grid is constructed by expanding the colored pixels diagonally to the top-right corner, forming a pattern of lines that extend from each colored pixel. The width and height of the output grid are indeed five times the number of colored pixels in the input grid. Thus, the description of option 1 matches the transformation process observed in the images."
398,ff28f65a,1,"1. To make the output, you have to...check how many 2x2 red squares are present in the input grid. Then, fill the corresponding number of 1x1 blue pixels in a 3x3 black background output grid. When filling the blue pixels, follow the order: top-left corner, top-right corner, center, bottom-left corner, bottom-right corner.

Explanation: By examining the images, we can see that each 2x2 red square in the input grid corresponds to a single blue pixel in the output grid, arranged in the specific order given in option 1. In each case, the number of blue pixels in the output grid matches the number of 2x2 red squares in the input grid, following the pattern of filling from the top-left corner and proceeding to the bottom-right corner within a 3x3 output grid."
399,ff805c23,5,"Based on the provided images and the options given, the correct answer would be:

5. To make the output, you have to...fill the blue square with the same pattern with the input grid.

Explanation: In all three images, there is a colored square within the input grid (pink in the first image, green in the second, and blue in the third), which is transferred to the output grid. The pattern of the square in the input grid is replicated in the same position in the output grid; the rest of the grid is filled with a single color. The common rule across the images is to find the uniquely colored square in the input grid and replicate its pattern in the output grid, which corresponds with option 5."
