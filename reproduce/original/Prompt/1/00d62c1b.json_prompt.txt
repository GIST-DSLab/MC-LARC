- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...observe the shape that forms the pattern in the input. Locate any filled regions of circles that are bordered by the curves that shape the secondary pattern, turn them green. You should finish with a completely different design from the input, where all filled areas are turned green.

2. To make the output, you have to...scrutinize the hue of the backdrop in the input. Locate any unoccupied parts of rectangles that are bound by the lines that inceive the additional design, dye them purple. You should wrap up with an amended blueprint of the original design from the input, with the unoccupied parts yed purple.

3. To make the output, you have to...examine the texture of the outline in the input. Identify any vacant spaces of squares that are confined by the contours that create the supportive design, stain them blue. You should conclude with a modified imprint of the original design from the input, having the vacant spaces stained blue.

4. To make the output, you have to...look at the color that form the design in the input. Find any empty areas of blocks that are enclosed by the lines that form the main design, fill them yellow.You should end with the same original design from the input, but with the empty areas filled yellow.

5. To make the output, you have to...study the pattern of the stripes in the input. Find any blank sections of spheres that are surrounded by the edges that construct the supplementary design, color them red. You should stop with an altered version of the original design from the input, with the blank sections painted red.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a pattern with green pixels and empty squares.
