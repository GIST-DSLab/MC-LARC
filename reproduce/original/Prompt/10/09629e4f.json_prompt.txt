- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...choose the square with the most colorful blocks in the pattern. Use that design to fill the blocks in the output design. The gray areas need to be replaced.

2. To make the output, you have to...find the square that has only four color blocks in the pattern. Use that design to fill the blocks in the output design. The gray areas stay the same.

3. To make the output, you have to...create a new square from the pattern and use that to fill the output design. The gray areas should be filled with a different color.

4. To make the output, you have to...pick the square that has the least color blocks and use it to fill the pattern, change the color of the gray areas as needed. 

5. To make the output, you have to...use a random square from the pattern and repeat it across the entire output area. The gray areas are not important.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a grid with 9 3x3 smaller squares with various color block patterns. The smaller squares are divided by gray line
