- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...replicate the plus sign three times in every direction without altering the color formation. This will result in a 9x9 square with mixed colors. 

2. To make the output, you have to...construct a circle using the color of the original plus sign. Paint over the circle with the center color, leaving only the edge in the original color.

3. To make the output, you have to...draw a 4x4 grid and fill the diagonal squares with the center color. All the other squares should be the color of the original plus sign. 

4. To make the output, you have to...create a 6x6 cross using the color of the original plus sign and fill the rest with the center color.

5. To make the output, you have to...extend the plus sign one square in every direction and then make a 5x5 'X' of the center color through the center square. You should result in nine squares the color of the center and eight the color of the original plus sign.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...two crosses with one color in the center of cross and another color around center of cross.
