- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...find the average length of all edges of the cube.

2. To make the output, you have to...correlate the design until you have a pattern on all 4 corners of the cube.

3. To make the output, you have to...paint over the existing design on the cube.

4. To make the output, you have to...print the pattern then paste it on the cube.

5. To make the output, you have to...freehand a sketch onto all 6 sides of the cube.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a 2x2 green cube consisting of four green pixels in the middle, surrounded by red pixel designs on a black tile background.
