- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... rotate the entire grid 90 degrees and then erase the colored lines.

2. To make the output, you have to... cover half of the input grid and then retrace the colored lines in a different pattern.

3. To make the output, you have to... redraw the whole grid on a new sheet and color the lines randomly.

4. To make the output, you have to... copy the input grid and then mirror the colored lines on the other end of the grid.

5. To make the output, you have to... flip the input grid upside down and then draw the colored lines anew.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see... a pattern of two colors on the top of the grid.
