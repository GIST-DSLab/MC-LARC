- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...copy the colors from the four corners of the input to the center blocks of the output, creating 4x4 blocks. Use colors from the center of the input grid to create 2x2 blocks in the middle of the outer spaces of the output. Paint each corner of the output grid in rainbow hues. If the output grid's number of blocks in height and width is even, color the center block.

2. To make the output, you have to...use black from the input grid's corner to create 4x4 blocks at the center of the output. Use colors from the middle of the input grid to create 3x3 blocks in any random places in the output. Leave every block of the output grid as it is. If the output's number of blocks in height and width is not odd, fill the center with a pattern of mixed colors.

3. To make the output, you have to...select a random color from the input grid and create 4x4 colored blocks at any corner of the output. Use any colors from the input grid to design the middle outer space of the output grid randomly. Color each corner of the output grid neon. If the output grid has an even number of height and width blocks, draw a pattern in the center.

4. To make the output, you have to...create 2x2 blocks using the color from the center of the input grid and place them in the corners of the output. Use colors from the outermost blocks of the input to create 1x1 blocks in the corresponding positions in the output. Leave each corner block of the output grid untouched. If the output has an even number of blocks in height and width, paint the center of the grid white.

5. To make the output, you have to...use the color from the input corner to make 4x4 blocks of the same colors in the corresponding corner of the output. Use colors in the middle outside blocks of the input grid to create 1x2 or 2x1 blocks in the corresponding middle outside space in the output. Black out each corner block of the output grid. If the output is not even in its number of blocks in height and width, black out the center of the grid.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...random color and random pattern of the grid.
