- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

2. To make the output, you have to...Take the first color, vertically or horizontally, then fill that color in the corresponding square in the output. Then the second and third...

3. To make the output, you have to...Take every other color from the list, fill in the squares accordingly, then return for the skipped colors.

4. To make the output, you have to...Begin with the last color, move upwards, filling each square with the respective color.

5. To make the output, you have to...Start with black, fill in the square, then go down the list adding more shades.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.
