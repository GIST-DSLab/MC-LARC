- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...shift the corner shape away from the x.

2. To make the output, you have to...inflate the shape until it fills the entire x.

3. To make the output, you have to...rotate the shape until it's parallel to the x-axis.

4. To make the output, you have to...adjust the shape slightly towards the x-axis.

5. To make the output, you have to...mirror the shape at the corner of the x to the other corners of the x so that the x is surrounded by the corner shape.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a colored x shape with another colored shape at one of its corners.
