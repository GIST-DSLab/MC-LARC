- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... randomly place squares of the two selected colors throughout the screen. The size and position of the squares should be different each time the output is generated. 

2. To make the output, you have to... create a pattern of short stripes alternating between the 2 colors. Start from the first colored pixel and create a line that goes to the opposite side using that color. Then go to the second colored pixel and do the same. Continue the pattern of stripes to the RIGHT for a long grid or go DOWN for a tall grid all the way to the end.

3. To make the output, you have to... start by drawing a pixel in the center of the canvas. With each successive pixel, move outwards in a spiral pattern, changing colors every other pixel.

4. To make the output, you have to... sprinkle colored dots across the canvas like confetti, covering every available surface until no white can be seen.

5. To make the output, you have to... use a looping process which gradually adds on additional colored pixels to the top right corner until the entire area is filled.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...two pixels of different colors on the upper or lower rim, or on the right or left rim.
