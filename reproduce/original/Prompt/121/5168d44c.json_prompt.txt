- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...move the green 3x3 block to the left one 'track' if the pattern is vertical. If the pattern is horizontal, move the green 3x3 block one 'track' up. In both situations, the position of the green blocks should solely change.

2. To make the output, you have to...move the red 3x3 block down one 'track' if the pattern is vertical. If the pattern is horizontal, move the red 3x3 block one 'track' to the right. In both instances, only the location of the red blocks should change.

3. To make the output, you have to...shift the cyan 5x5 block up one 'track' regardless of whether the pattern is vertical or horizontal. In both instances, only the position of the cyan blocks should change.

4. To make the output, you have to...invert the entire pattern, meaning the lower part goes up and the upper part comes down. Ensure no color or placements are altered during this transition.

5. To make the output, you have to...rotate the blue 2x2 block clockwise by 90 degrees, irrespective of the pattern's arrangement. Under all conditions, only the orientation of the blue blocks should alter.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...green pixels that is aligned either horizontally or vertically. And there is a one pixel of space between each of them. And one of these green pixels is surrounded by red pixels.
