- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...begin by filling the entire grid with the color black. Afterward, decide what pattern to create based on pure intuition.

2. To make the output, you have to...first, recognize for the input that any section in BLACK is just left-over grid space and is NOT part of the pattern.Start with the central square-shape and copy the pattern block-by-block. Keep extending the pattern, repeating it the entire grid is filled. For each section the same color as the central square-shape, the thickness is the same as the width of the square.Whatever color the central center-square is, same color patterns as the center-square should also have the same thickness as the width of the center-square (in boxes). (Example: 4x4 blue center-square = blue patterns should be 4 boxes wide)

3. To make the output, you have to...commence with the corner blocks and slowly work your way in. Colors should not repeat and there is no specific width for each section.

4. To make the output, you have to...start with whatever color you prefer. There's no need to follow the center-square, and the thickness of the patterns varies widely.

5. To make the output, you have to...first, ignore the input and start drawing randomly on the grid. Make sure not to repeat patterns and colors.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...see various sizes and colors of squares overlaid, aligned with the top-left corner, in a 5x5 grid.
