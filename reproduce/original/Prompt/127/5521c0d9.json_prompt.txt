- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...shift all objects to the right according to the number of rows they have.

2. To make the output, you have to...count how many rows each object contains and move it up that same amount of rows.

3. To make the output, you have to...remove the specified number of rows from each object.

4. To make the output, you have to...add a constant number of rows to every object.

5. To make the output, you have to...multiply the number of rows per object and place them in a new column.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
