- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...maneuver the red pattern to lie against the green line, then remove a blue line from the red pattern, parallel to the green line.

2. To make the output, you have to...rotate the green pattern to lie over the blue line, then subtract a red line from the green pattern, in line with the blue pattern.

3. To make the output, you have to...align the blue pattern to coincide with the green line, then embed a red line within the blue pattern, orthogonal to the green line.

4. To make the output, you have to...shift the red line to match the blue pattern, then insert a green line against the red one, perpendicular to the blue pattern.

5. To make the output, you have to...move the green pattern against the red line, then add a blue line against the green pattern parallel with the red line.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a red vertical or horizontal line and a random shape of pattern composed with green pixels.
