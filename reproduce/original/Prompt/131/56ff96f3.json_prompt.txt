- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...identify the hexagonal shapes on the grid and start creating the circle from there.

2. To make the output, you have to...try to count the edges of the grid and then create a triangle within.

3. To make the output, you have to...use the circles as the foundation for your pyramid and construct it accordingly.

4. To make the output, you have to...focus on the intersections of the grid lines for creating a perfect sphere.

5. To make the output, you have to...take the colored as the starting and end point of the rectangle or square assume that the grid make rectangle or square.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...one or more pairs of colored pixels.
