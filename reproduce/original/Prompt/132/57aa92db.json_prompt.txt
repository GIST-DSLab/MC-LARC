- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...use the common round grids and fill them with the unique shape.

2. To make the output, you have to...use the unique shaped grids and fill the incomplete with the unique shape.

3. To make the output, you have to...use the unique shaped grids and replace the complete with the unique shape. 

4. To make the output, you have to...draw the exact picture on the grid by using the unique shape. 

5. To make the output, you have to...design the unique shaped grid without filling any shape.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...1 complete unique shape object with one different color pixel. And you should see two squares that are incomplete and made of different colors, but they are attached to each other.
