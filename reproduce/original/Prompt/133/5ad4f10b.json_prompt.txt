- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...take the color pattern and move to new grid with color 2. The output pattern will be a smaller than the input.

2. To make the output, you have to...keep the color pattern the same and move to new grid with color 1. The output pattern will be bigger than the input.

3. To make the output, you have to...discard the color pattern and move to new grid with color 3. The output pattern will be larger than the input.

4. To make the output, you have to...invert the color pattern and move to new grid with color 5. The output pattern will be the same size as the input.

5. To make the output, you have to...change the color pattern and remain on the old grid with color 2. The output pattern will be equal to the input.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...black background with large and colored pattern. And you can see many pixels with another color around the pattern.
