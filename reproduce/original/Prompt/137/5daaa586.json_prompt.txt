- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...copy the inner square or rectangular shape to the input then fill in the middle from the color line that match the pixels already there, to the colored pixel. This can be up, down, left, or right, start from the colored edge and fill in to the pixel with the same color.

2. To make the output, you have to...highlight the spatial or circular shape, then adjust the center by adding more color until you reach the boundary. This could go vertical or horizontal, starting from the boundary and deepening the color towards the center.

3. To make the output, you have to...select the outer triangle or circular shape and then erase the middle until you get to the colored line. This can be angled at any direction, starting from the edge with no color and erasing towards the pixel that has a different color.

4. To make the output, you have to...choose the pentagonal shape, then fill the exterior with color that contrasts the pixels inside. This could be outward or inward, beginning from any pixel and filling out to the contrasting color.

5. To make the output, you have to...generate the hexagonal or cylindrical shape and then draw a line from the center to the colored boundary. This can be diagonal or straight, commencing from the center and proceeding towards the colored area.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...four colored lines that form a square or rectangular shape. And there are scattered single colored pixels.
