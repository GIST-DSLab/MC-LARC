- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...create a spiral pattern originating from the colored square, ignoring the x shape suggestion.

2. To make the output, you have to...start at the colored square and add a same colored square to make a x shape for the whole square

3. To make the output, you have to...start at the corner of the grid and work inwards without concern for color.

4. To make the output, you have to...begin at the colored square and form a z shape instead of an x shape.

5. To make the output, you have to...randomly fill the square grid with different colors regardless of the starting square.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...one colored pixel on a black background.
