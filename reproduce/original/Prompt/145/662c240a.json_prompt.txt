- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...compose a diagonally symmetrical 5x5 grid from a 10x5 grid. It is assembled with 5 Multi-color 5x5 grids, which are vertically connected in.

2. To make the output, you have to...assemble a non-symmetrical 2x3 grid from a 6x3 grid. It is constructed with 3 single-color 2x2 grids, which are horizontally aligned.

3. To make the output, you have to...replicate a non-diagonally symmetrical 3x3 grid from a 9x3 grid. It is composed with 3 Two-color 3x3 grids, which are vertically connected in.

4. To make the output, you have to...copy a diagonally symmetrical 3x2 grid from a 9x3 grid. It is composed with 2 single-color 3x3 grids, which are horizontally connected.

5. To make the output, you have to...align a non-diagonally symmetrical 4x4 grid from a 8x4 grid. It is composed with 4 Three-color 2x2 grids, which are vertically connected.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a 3x3 grid connected vertically to form a continuous 9x3 grid. Each 3x3 grid is composed of pixels in two different colors.
