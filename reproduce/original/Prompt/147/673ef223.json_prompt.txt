- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...replace the blue star with a purple one, and connect them to the pink curve using red stars. Duplicate the same pattern on the right, but rather than stopping where the purple stars WOULD be, proceed to the boundary of the rectangle.

2. To make the output, you have to...swap the blue dot for a green one and connect them to the orange line with purple dots. Extend the same model to the top, but halt at the green dots instead of progressing to the grid's edge.

3. To make the output, you have to...change the dot color from blue to yellow, and connect them to the red line using blue dots. Mirror the same design on the bottom but instead of stopping where the yellow dots WOULD be, continue to the edge of the grid.

4. To make the output, you have to...alter the circle color from green to orange, and bind them to the blue square using green circles. Imitate the same structure on the top, but instead of ceasing where the orange circles WOULD be, advance towards the corner of the pentagon.

5. To make the output, you have to...change the square color from red to pink and link it to the green triangle with yellow squares. Replicate the same layout on the left, but instead of finishing where the pink squares WOULD be, continue to the end of the circle.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...two short red lines attached to the left and right sides. The two red lines are not facing each other. The upper red line has several light blue single pixels on the facing horizontal side.
