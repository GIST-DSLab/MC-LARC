- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...invert the color of the grid column. black to white, brown to clear, orange to teal, and vice versa

2. To make the output, you have to...change the size of the grid column.

3. To make the output, you have to...shift the positions of the grid column.

4. To make the output, you have to...multiply the numbers in the grid column.

5. To make the output, you have to...change the color of the grid column into specific color. grey to dark blue, light blue to dark red, magenta to light red, green to yellow and vice versa

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
