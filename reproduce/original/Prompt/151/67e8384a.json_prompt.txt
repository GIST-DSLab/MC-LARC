- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...replicate the blueprint at each vertex. The pattern on the bottom is a mirror reflection of the top.

2. To make the output, you have to...modify the initial pattern across all corners. Then, invert the tops to reflect the bottoms. 

3. To make the output, you have to...duplicate the design at each edge. Let the pattern at the peak duplicate at the base. 

4. To make the output, you have to...copy-paste the pattern in each corner. The pattern on the bottoms flips parallel to the top.

5. To make the output, you have to...repeat the motif at every corner. Ensure the top patterns horizontally match the bottom ones.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a 3 x 3 grid with various color pattern.
