- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to....it's the grey shapes surrounding the red shapes and being inverted upside down.

2. To make the output, you have to....the grey shapes are finally in the interior of the red shapes. But not touching the red. And flipped on the vertical.

3. To make the output, you have to....the red shapes are inside the grey shapes with direct contact to the grey, and flipped on a horizontal basis.

4. To make the output, you have to....the grey shapes are externally aligned with the blue shapes. Without any contact with the red.

5. To make the output, you have to....the red shapes are surpassing the grey shapes, and the grey shapes are rotated horizontally.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...two parallel red brackets facing each other. And behind each bracket, there is a gray object, one for each. The gray shapes are both different in shape.
