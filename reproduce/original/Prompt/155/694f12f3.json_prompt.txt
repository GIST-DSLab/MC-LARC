- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...fill the pattern by red and blue color randomly without considering the number of internal blocks.

2. To make the output, you have to...fill the pattern by red and blue color surrounded by same color, the one with most internal block should be filled with red color.

3. To make the output, you have to...fill the pattern by yellow and green color regardless of the surrounding color.

4. To make the output, you have to...leave the pattern empty, without filling it with any colors.

5. To make the output, you have to...fill the pattern with the same color all over without considering any blocks.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.
