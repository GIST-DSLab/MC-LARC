- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...sketch the shapes in light green to cover the vacant yellow triangles at the bottom, then shade the magenta rectangles brown.

2. To make the output, you have to...paint the patterns in pink to occupy the blank turquoise ovals on the left, then color the lime diamond tan.

3. To make the output, you have to...stamp the figures in orange to fill the empty purple circles on the right, then tint the cyan hexagon maroon.

4. To make the output, you have to...paste the shapes in violet to fill the blank red squares at the side, then color the beige squares white.

5. To make the output, you have to...draw the shapes in dark blue to fill the empty black squares at the top, then color the gray squares black.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a various types of gray shapes on the floor. Above them, there is a red panel with grooves corresponding to the shapes of the gray objects below.
