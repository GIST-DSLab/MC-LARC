- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...rotate the input grid 90 degrees clockwise before interpreting it.

2. To make the output, you have to...copy only the colored pixels from the input grid, ignoring the black ones.

3. To make the output, you have to...copy input grid exactly. Fill in all black boxes to draw establish pattern.

4. To make the output, you have to...remove all black boxes from the input grid and then fill the remaining spaces with an alternating pattern of colors.

5. To make the output, you have to...invert the color of each pixel in the input grid and then replicate it.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see....a repeating tile pattern.
