- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...draw one line connecting one pair of colored squares and leave the other pair disconnected.

2. To make the output, you have to...link all colored squares in a triangular pattern, regardless of their respective colors.

3. To make the output, you have to...connect each pair of colored squares using a line of a different color.

4. To make the output, you have to...draw two lines connecting both pairs of colored squares, all the way across the grid, same color as the squares (for instance, if you noticed that you have 4 green squares on the input, on the output connect the ones on top and bottom edge of the grid with a green line, and the ones on left and right edge of the grid with a green line). If both sets of squares are on the top/bottom or left/right, connect the lines across the grid, not along the edge (in other words, do not connect the two left squares or two top squares. Always connect the line to the opposite square). All other squares on your grid that are not your lines should be black.

5. To make the output, you have to...change the color of all squares except for the ones connected by a line.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a black background with a bunch of colored squares on it. You should also notice that only one of the colors has 4 pixels. And they are aligned vertically or horizontally.
