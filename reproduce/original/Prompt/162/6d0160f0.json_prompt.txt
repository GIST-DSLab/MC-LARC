- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...take the 3x3 area with a yellow square and move it into a 3x3 area corresponding to where the yellow square is within the 9 squares. Then make all other squares within the other 9 squares black and any grey squares within the 9 squares black. The lines of grey stay.

2. To make the output, you have to...swap the yellow square with a grey square within the 3x3 area, then turn all squares within the 9 squares green. Keep the lines of grey unchanged.

3. To make the output, you have to...move all the squares in the 3x3 area into another random 3x3 area, then change their color to yellow. Leave remaining squares as they are.

4. To make the output, you have to...take the 3x3 area with a blue square and slide that into a 3x3 area corresponding to the location of the green square within the 9 squares. Turn all squares within the 3x3 area white except for the blue square.

5. To make the output, you have to...pick the 3x3 area with a red square and relocate it to a 3x3 area in line with where the red square is among the 9 squares. Then change all squares except the 9 squares to black while making all blue squares within the 9 squares black. Don't alter the grid lines.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...9 sections divided eqaully by gray vertical and horizontal lines. And each section contains some color pixels. And there is only one yellow pixel.
