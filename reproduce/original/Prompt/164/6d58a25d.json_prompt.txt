- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...draw a horizontal line starting from the point shape to where there is a triangle with the same color as the triangle.

2. To make the output, you have to...create a vertical line above the point shape only at the point where there is a circle, matching the color of the circle.

3. To make the output, you have to...draw a diagonal line from the point shape ONLY where there is a hexagon below it, with the same color of the hexagon but sharpen it at the top.

4. To make the output, you have to...make a vertical line under the point shape ONLY where there is a square under it, with a different color from the square and draw it up to the top.

5. To make the output, you have to...make vertical line under the point shape ONLY where there is a square under it, with the same color of the square and draw it down to the bottom.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...an up point shape with different colored squares around it.
