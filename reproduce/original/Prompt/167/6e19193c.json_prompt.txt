- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to....fill a diagonal line starting from the center of L-shaped that continues until the edge of the grid, in the same color as the input grid

2. To make the output, you have to....start from the edge of the grid and fill an entire diagonal line with a color that is not present in the input grid.

3. To make the output, you have to....fill a diagonal line starting from one corner of the grid that continues until the center, in the contrasting color from the input grid.

4. To make the output, you have to....draw a horizontal line from the center of the grid using the same color as the input grid.

5. To make the output, you have to....fill an entire L-shaped starting from the edge of the grid, following the center line, using a different color than the input grid.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...two L-shaped areas consisting of three pixels, all the same color.
