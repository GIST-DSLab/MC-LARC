- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...push a group of 2 blocks aside, enlarge a group of 3 blocks by 50%, shrink a group of 4 blocks by 25%, color a group of 5 blocks in multicolor.

2. To make the output, you have to...remove a group of 2 blocks, add a group of 3 blocks on the left side, split a group of 4 blocks into 2 groups of 2 blocks, rearrange a group of 5 blocks in a circle.

3. To make the output, you have to...change a group of 2 blocks from gray to green, change a group of 3 blocks from gray to red, change a group of 4 blocks from gray to blue.

4. To make the output, you have to...paint a group of 2 blocks white, transform a group of 3 blocks into spheres, switch a group of 4 blocks with a group of 5 blocks, place a group of 6 blocks on top of each other.

5. To make the output, you have to...change a group of 6 blocks from gray to violet, move a group of 2 blocks from the left to the right, turn a group of 3 blocks from green to yellow, rotate a group of 4 blocks 90 degrees clockwise. 

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...various gray blocks composed of 2, 3, or 4 gray pixels, each in different shapes.
