- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...create a new pattern that does not exist in the large rectangular area and apply it to the small rectangular area

2. To make the output, you have to...discard the small rectangular pattern and focus on reproducing the large rectangular area

3. To make the output, you have to...eliminate the black pattern from both the small and the large rectangular areas

4. To make the output, you have to...transfer the black pattern from the small rectangular area to the large rectangular area

5. To make the output, you have to...reproduce the small rectangular pattern then reproduce the black pattern from the large rectangular area onto the small rectangular area

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a large grid with a large pattern of the same color, and a small pattern with many colors.
