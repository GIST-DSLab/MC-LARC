- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...create a red grid in the center, leaving a black border around the edges. The rest of the squares inside the red grid remain black.

2. To make the output, you have to...create a pattern within the grid using different colors. The edge color does not differ from the inner ones.

3. To make the output, you have to...fill all squares with black and then create a border in yellow. The space inside the yellow border remains black. 

4. To make the output, you have to...create a light blue border around the grid. So, any squares that are touching the edges are filled in with light blue. The rest of the squares inside the light blue border remain black.

5. To make the output, you have to...leave all squares black without creating any form of border. 

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a black grid.
