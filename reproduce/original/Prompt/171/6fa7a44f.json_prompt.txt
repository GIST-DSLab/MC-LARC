- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...place the input grid in the top 3x3 space and create a mirror image in the bottom 3x3 space.

2. To make the output, you have to...create a mirror image of the input grid in the right 3x3 space and leave the left 3x3 space blank.

3. To make the output, you have to...rotate the input grid 180 degrees and place it in the top 3x3 space.

4. To make the output, you have to...place the input grid in the bottom 3x3 space and create a mirror image in the top 3x3 space.

5. To make the output, you have to...swap the colors of the input grid and place it in the bottom 3x3 space.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a 3x3 pattern with random color.
