- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...color pattern set of what order the colors were used in. Even if the line is thick, use color once at one line.

2. To make the output, you have to... use each color a specific number of times. The pattern or order of the colors does not matter.

3. To make the output, you have to... use only a select few colors from the set. Not all colors need to be used.

4. To make the output, you have to... randomize the order of the colors used. It does not matter if you end up using the same color twice in a row.

5. To make the output, you have to... neglect the thickness of the line. Use the same color for several lines if required.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
