- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... distort the pattern and plummet it deep into the corner.

2. To make the output, you have to... mirror the pattern and focus the pattern around to the left.

3. To make the output, you have to... remove the pattern and toss it upwards in the center.

4. To make the output, you have to... ignore the pattern and slide it down to the far end.

5. To make the output, you have to... alter the pattern and push it towards the right.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
