- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...Start with the bottom-left pattern (pink). Then, place the bottom-right (brown) pattern on top. Now superimpose the top-left (yellow) pattern and finally the top-right (gray) pattern. Treat the black squares as if they are white.

2. To make the output, you have to...Merge the top-left (yellow) pattern with the bottom-right (brown) pattern. Then, place the bottom-left pattern (pink) on top. Then, place the top-right (gray) pattern on top. Remember to keep all squares opaque.

3. To make the output, you have to...First take the top-right (gray) pattern. Then, place the top-left (yellow) pattern on top. Next, place the bottom-right (brown) pattern. Lastly, put the bottom-left pattern (pink) on top of all. Consider the black squares to be white.

4. To make the output, you have to...Copy the top-left (yellow) pattern. Then, place the bottom-right (brown) pattern on top. Then, place the bottom-left pattern (pink) on top. Then, place the top-right (gray) pattern on top. Imagine the black squares are transparent, so every time you superimpose each pattern the one below can be seen through the black squares.

5. To make the output, you have to...Copy the bottom-left pattern (pink). On top of it, place the top-left (yellow) pattern. Then add the bottom-right (brown) pattern. Finally, superimpose the top-right (gray) pattern. Assume the black squares as opaque.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...an 8x8 grid with a black background and 4 distinct quadrants. The top left quadrant shows a yellow pattern, the top right quadrant shows a gray pattern, the bottom left shows a pink pattern, the bottom right shows a brown pattern.
