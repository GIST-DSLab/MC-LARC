- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...rotate the top shape 180 degrees about its axis.

2. To make the output, you have to...create a mirror image of the top shape and place it to the side of that shape.

3. To make the output, you have to...scale the dimensions of the top shape by half and place it inside the original.

4. To make the output, you have to...invert the top shape and put it underneath the original one.

5. To make the output, you have to...cut the top shape into half diagonally and join the parts.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a 6x9 grid with a light blue object in the middle at the top, and a yellow object in the middle at the bottom.
