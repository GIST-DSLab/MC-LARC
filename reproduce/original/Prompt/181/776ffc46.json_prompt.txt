- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...copy all shapes over to output including the gray borders. Change the colors of the same shapes that are in the gray border to the same color as the one in the gray border.

2. To make the output, you have to... erase all shapes in the gray border and replace them with different ones.

3. To make the output, you have to... Move all shapes from gray border to the output but keep their original colors.

4. To make the output, you have to... Remove the gray borders around the shapes before copying them to the output.

5. To make the output, you have to... Leave the shapes in the gray border and only copy the other shapes to the output.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a specific-shaped object inside the gray border. Outside of it, there are various objects made of blue color, and among them, some have the same shape as the object inside the gray border.
