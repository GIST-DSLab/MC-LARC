- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...switch the blocks with another one of a different color.

2. To make the output, you have to...continue the single block diagonally to the edge with the same color.

3. To make the output, you have to...place multiple blocks along the edge.

4. To make the output, you have to...flip the block upside down.

5. To make the output, you have to...rotate the block clockwise until it matches the color on the edge.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...2x2 grid square. In some corners of this square, there may be pixels of the same color.
