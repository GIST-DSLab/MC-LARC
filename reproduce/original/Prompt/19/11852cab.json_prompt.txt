- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...erase the existing pattern and create a new one

2. To make the output, you have to...replace the given colors with different ones

3. To make the output, you have to...complete the pattern that is not there by color each side with the color that is not there to complete the pattern

4. To make the output, you have to...duplicate the existing pattern on the other side

5. To make the output, you have to...shade the entire pattern with one color

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.
