- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... remove the 9x9 pattern. Then, within each gray 3x3 square, reproduce the 9x9 pattern, so that each 3x3 gray square is a smaller version of the 9x9 pattern.

2. To make the output, you have to... reproduce the 9x9 pattern. Then, within each gray 3x3 square, reproduce the 9x9 pattern, so that each 3x3 gray square is a smaller version of the 9x9 pattern.

3. To make the output, you have to... reproduce the 9x9 pattern. Then, within each gray 3x3 square, invert the 9x9 pattern, so that each 3x3 gray square is a larger version of the 9x9 pattern.

4. To make the output, you have to... reproduce the 9x9 pattern. Then, within each blue 3x3 square, reproduce the 9x9 pattern, so that each 3x3 blue square is a smaller version of the 9x9 pattern.

5. To make the output, you have to... reproduce the 5x5 pattern. Then, within each gray 3x3 square, reproduce the 9x9 pattern, so that each 3x3 gray square is a smaller version of the 9x9 pattern.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see... a black background, within which is a 9x9 pattern composed of nine solid 3x3 gray and black squares.
