- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...rotate the input grid 180 degrees. Then, change all squares that were on the outside edge to black.

2. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid. Then, any shapes that are closed (like complete squares or rectangles) will be changed from blue to green. Any other shapes that are open (incomplete) or are just lines, stay blue.

3. To make the output, you have to...identify the center of the input grid. Then, color the center square purple. All other squares remain their original color.

4. To make the output, you have to...remove all the shapes from the grid. Then, add new shapes of your choosing. Feel free to choose any color you want.

5. To make the output, you have to...make all shapes on the grid red. Don't worry about whether they are closed or open.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...various blue objects. Among them, some are completely surrounded by blue pixels, while others have empty spaces in the center.
