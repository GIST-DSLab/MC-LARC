- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...construct a dissimilar grid. Pull the color piece upward 1x. Establish a streak of blue above the color piece. Leap the line to the right and left and copy only red lines on each vacant space.

2. To make the output, you have to...craft a similar grid. Push the color piece right 1x. Make a row of green aside the color piece. Miss the line to the left and right, echo only pink lines on every other space.

3. To make the output, you have to?ÃÂ¦form a contrasting grid. Push the color piece left 1x. Construct a line of cyan beneath the color piece. Skip the line down and up, continue only gray lines on all space.

4. To make the output, you have to...frame an identical grid. Push the color piece up 1x. Arrange a column of red beneath the color piece. Skip the line to the up and down and redo only green lines on every third space.

5. To make the output, you have to...make identical grid. push the color piece down 1x. Make a line of yellow above the color piece. Skip the line to the right and left and repeat only yellow lines on every other space.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a colored single pixel on the grid.
