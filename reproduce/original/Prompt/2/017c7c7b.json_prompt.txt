- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...reduce the image size to a small thumbnail and apply a sepia filter.

2. To make the output, you have to...color all solid lines in green on a floor plan design.

3. To make the output, you have to...identify a repeating blue pixel pattern and fill the repeated pattern with red pixels on a 6x9 grid.

4. To make the output, you have to...draw a triangle in the center of a square base pyramid model.

5. To make the output, you have to...rotate a 3D cube 45 degrees clockwise and increase its transparency to 70%.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a 3x6 grid pattern with blue pixels.
