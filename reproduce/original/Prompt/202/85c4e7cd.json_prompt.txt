- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...replace the inner most color with the outer most colors and complete the same steps with every color until all have been changed. In other words, invert the order of the colors.

2. To make the output, you have to...shuffle the colors randomly without following any pattern.

3. To make the output, you have to...maintain the sequence of the colors as it is with no changes. 

4. To make the output, you have to...replace the outermost color with the innermost color while keeping the other colors the same. 

5. To make the output, you have to...change only one color and keep the others the same. 

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a grid with different colored square border that get smaller and smaller until it reaches the center.
