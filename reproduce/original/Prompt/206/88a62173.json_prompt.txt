- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... rotate a standalone 5x5 grid, different in configuration than the rest 5x5 grid patterns, around the center of the output grid.

2. To make the output, you have to... copy a single 1x1 grid, which is identical in shape to the other 1x1 grid patterns, in the center of the output grid.

3. To make the output, you have to... move a whole 3x3 grid, which is distinct in arrangement from other 3x3 grid patterns, to the edges on the output grid.

4. To make the output, you have to... replicate a single 2x2 grid, which is different in shape from the other 2x2 grid patterns, at each of the four corners onto the output grid.

5. To make the output, you have to... transpose an individual 4x4 grid, which is similar in structure to other 4x4 grid patterns, at random positions on the output grid.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a black cross in the center that divide the four corners into 2x2 grid sections. There is one pattern in each section, and there are a total of four patterns. Among them, only one has a different shape.
