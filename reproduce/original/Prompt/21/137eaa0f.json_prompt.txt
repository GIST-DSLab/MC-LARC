- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...move each pattern so that the gray square in each pattern occupies the center square of the output 3x3 grid.

2. To make the output, you have to...rotate each pattern such that the white square in each pattern occupies the corner squares of the output 3x3 grid.

3. To make the output, you have to...shift each pattern so that the blue square in each pattern sits on the last square of the output 3x3 grid.

4. To make the output, you have to...resize each pattern so that the red square in each pattern fills the entire output 3x3 grid.

5. To make the output, you have to...flip each pattern so that the black square in each pattern occupies the top row of the output 3x3 grid.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...several color patterns that each contain a single gray square.
