- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...drizzle some green strokes until it reaches the circle.

2. To make the output, you have to...brush the line with shades of purple until you connect two black dots.

3. To make the output, you have to...stamp the line with pink until it intersects with a square.

4. To make the output, you have to...blur the line with yellow until it merges with an oval.

5. To make the output, you have to...complete a line with the colors. If it's red, fill the line in until you hit the gray bar. If it's blue, fill in until you hit the bottom or top edge.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a horizontal gray lines in middle. And two sections divided by gray lines contain blue and red pixels.
