- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...repeat the color lines in the same horizontal or vertical order as they appear in the input. The lines should go all the way across the grid to form stripes that are in the same color order and orientation as the input.

2. To make the output, you have to...select only one color line and repeat it across the grid.

3. To make the output, you have to...randomize the color lines in the grid.

4. To make the output, you have to...blur the color lines together instead of keeping them separate.

5. To make the output, you have to...draw all the color lines diagonally.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...colored lines and a gray square.
