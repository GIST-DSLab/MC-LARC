- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... only use the size and position of single colored pixels, excluding the solid rectangular block.

2. To make the output, you have to... replace all single colored pixels with the solid rectangular block.

3. To make the output, you have to... only copy the size and position of the solid rectangular block, except other single colored pixels.

4. To make the output, you have to... alter the size and position of the solid rectangular block, but keep other single colored pixels.

5. To make the output, you have to... eliminate the solid rectangular block and only use single colored pixels.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see... a grid of random colors with a solid rectangle clearly visible.
