- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...fill the left-upper black area with blue; the middle with red; and the green in the right-down.

2. To make the output, you have to...fill the right-lower green area with black; the top with yellow; and the blue in the left-middle.

3. To make the output, you have to...fill the middle brown area with orange; the left side with pink; and the red in the right-middle.

4. To make the output, you have to...fill the right-upper blue area with violet; the border with grey; and the white in the left-down.

5. To make the output, you have to...fill the left-lower white area with purple; the middle with cyan; and the yellow in the right-up.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
