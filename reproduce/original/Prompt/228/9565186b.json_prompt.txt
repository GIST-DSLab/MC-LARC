- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...color all squares randomly.  

2. To make the output, you have to...remove the color from the most squares and leave the rest in their original color.

3. To make the output, you have to...keep the color with the most squares and everything else should be gray.

4. To make the output, you have to...make everything the same color.

5. To make the output, you have to...shade the area with the fewest squares and leave the rest white.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...3x3 grid with various color of pixels.
