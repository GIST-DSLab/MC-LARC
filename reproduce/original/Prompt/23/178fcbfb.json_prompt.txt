- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...check for any blue circles. Connect them with a yellow swirl if found. Fill in any green or red circles next. Ignore any blue circles from the initial scan.

2. To make the output, you have to...outline any green triangles with a purple line. Then trace a zigzag pattern over the red and blue rectangles. Skip over any green triangles from the start.

3. To make the output, you have to...draw a vertical red line through any red squares. Then draw lines, left to right, for the green and blue squares. Go over any red squares from before.

4. To make the output, you have to...cross any yellow diamonds with a black X. Create a spiral pattern in any red and green hexagons afterward. Bypass any yellow diamonds from the starting point.

5. To make the output, you have to...draw a horizontal green line through any blue squares. Then paint in circles for any red and green squares. Avoid touching any blue squares from before.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a grid with red, blue, and green squares.
