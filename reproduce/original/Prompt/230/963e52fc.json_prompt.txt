- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...repeat the same pattern of colors in the input pixels to the grid created in the output in the same position

2. To make the output, you have to...reduce the size of the input pixel pattern by 50% before placing it in the output grid

3. To make the output, you have to...rotate the pattern of colors in the input pixels 90 degrees clockwise before inserting into the output grid

4. To make the output, you have to...invert the color pattern from the input pixels before applying it to the output grid

5. To make the output, you have to...remove all the colors from the input pixels and replace them with grayscale in the output grid

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a horizontal colored line in the middle repeating same pattern.
