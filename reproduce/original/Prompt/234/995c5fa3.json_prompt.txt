- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...create four rows of different striped patterns corresponding to the colour of the 4x4 blocks. The first 4x4 block is the color of the top row, and so on. A 4x4 green block with a 2x2 black box in the middle = orange. A 4x4 pink block with no black = purple. A 4x4 white block with black box center bottom = turquoise. A 4x4 blue block with two 1x2 black lines on the left and right = brown. If there are any more, they are a different color.

2. To make the output, you have to...draw lines in the pattern of the black boxes across the grey 4x4 blocks. The grey 4x4 block with a horizontal line in the middle is brown, grey 4x4 with vertical line = dark blue, grey 4x4 with a line diagonal from top left to bottom right = red, grey 4x4 with lines creating a frame = lime green. Additional patterns will yield another color.

3. To make the output, you have to...make three rows of three different solid colors corresponding to the grey 4x4 blocks. The first 4x4 block is the color of the top row, and so on.Grey 4x4 with a 2x2 black box in the middle = light blueGrey 4x4 with no black = redGrey 4x4 with black box center bottom = yellowGrey 4x4 with two 1x2 black lines on the left and right = greenIf there are any more, they are a different color.

4. To make the output, you have to...replace the black squares with white and match each 4x4 grey block with a pattern of dots. Grey 4x4 with a 2x2 white circle in the middle = pink, grey 4x4 with no white = green, grey 4x4 with white circle at the center bottom = yellow, grey 4x4 with white dots placed at random = purple. Additional patterns correspond to different colors.

5. To make the output, you have to...ignore the grey and black boxes entirely and fill the block with a representation of a natural scene. A beach scene corresponds to a blue 4x4 block, a forest scene to green, desert to yellow and mountains to purple. Any other scene will result in a different color.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...three 4x4 grey grids divide by black lines.
