- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... adjust the shape of the colored object to match the light blue object, then replace the colored outlines with light blue blocks.

2. To make the output, you have to...flip the colored object and place it on top of the light blue object. Then change the middle blocks adjacent to the colored outlines to light blue.

3. To make the output, you have to...enlarge the colored object and shrink the light blue object before fitting it into the colored object. No color changes are required.

4. To make the output, you have to...copy the colored object and copy the light blue object inside the colored object. Then change the middle light blue blocks adjacent to the colored outlines to the same color.

5. To make the output, you have to...remove the colored object and replace it with the light blue object, then change the light blue blocks around the colored outlines to a different color.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a colored rectangle object without corner pixels. And a light blue object that fits perfectly inside the rectangle object's internal size.
