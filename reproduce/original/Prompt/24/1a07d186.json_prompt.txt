- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...remove the different color that does not match the rest. move the single squares so they are in the same horizontal or vertical place depending if it is a vertical or horizontal line and have them touch the same side the single squares were on.

2. To make the output, you have to...rotate the image until the different color square aligns with the other squares.

3. To make the output, you have to...change the color of the different square to match the rest, and then shift all squares to the center of the canvas.

4. To make the output, you have to...slide the single squares diagonally until they intersect with the other squares at the corner points.

5. To make the output, you have to...combine all the squares of the same color regardless of their position.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...horizontal or vertical lines, and some colored single pixels.
