- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... draw a complex diagram in the black square section

2. To make the output, you have to... erase everything in the black square section

3. To make the output, you have to... clean the black square section

4. To make the output, you have to... fill the black square section with words

5. To make the output, you have to... finish the pattern that would be in the black square section

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a radial symmetric pattern, but some parts are obscured by a 3x3 black grid.
