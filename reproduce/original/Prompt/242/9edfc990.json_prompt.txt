- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...occupy all blocks with blue color even if the blue block doesn't exist there.

2. To make the output, you have to...fill out the white blocks only, leaving the blue ones empty.

3. To make the output, you have to...fill out the blue color to the area of where the blue block exists. when there is no blue block there is no need to fill up, just leave those blocks as empty.

4. To make the output, you have to...remove all the blue blocks from the area before filling it up.

5. To make the output, you have to...paint the entire area blue, regardless of where the blue blocks exist.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...randomly filled with color pixels on balck background
