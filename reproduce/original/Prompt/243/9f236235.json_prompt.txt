- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...concentrate on the lines that form the rectangles, then reflect them vertically (top to bottom). This should provide just the figure from the input.

2. To make the output, you have to...concentrate on the curves that shape the ovals, then flip them diagonally. You should get only the diagram from the input.

3. To make the output, you have to...avoid the lines that create the boxes, and instead focus on the pattern. Copy the pattern so that it is mirrored horizontally (left to right). You should end up with only the design from the input.

4. To make the output, you have to...dismiss the lines creating angles and put an emphasis on the pattern. Rotate the pattern so that it's perpendicular. The end result should be just the composition from the input.

5. To make the output, you have to...revoke all the lines forming circles, and focus completely on the pattern. Invert the pattern so it's inverted vertically and horizontally. You should end up with just the sketch from the input.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...multiple sections divided eqaully by horizontal and vertical lines. Some sections are filled with color pixels, fully.
