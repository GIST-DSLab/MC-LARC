- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...change the entire background in yellow and you need to look at the yellow space in both input pattern compare them now color the similar yellow space with dark blue color.

2. To make the output, you have to...change the entire background in white and monitor the white space in both input pattern compare them now color the similar white space with light green color.

3. To make the output, you have to...change the entire background in orange and you have to study the orange space in both input pattern compare them now color the similar orange space with light purple color.

4. To make the output, you have to...change the entire background in red and you must observe the red space in both input pattern compare them now color the similar red space with dark orange color.

5. To make the output, you have to...change the entire background in black and you have to watch the black space in both input pattern compare them now color the similar black space with light blue color.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...two brown pattern with same grid size and a blue line in the middle.
