- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...color the inside blue but if the border of shape goes outside the grid leave inside black.

2. To make the output, you have to...dye the core orange but if the edge of model outsides the matrix leave inside brown.

3. To make the output, you have to...tint the middle purple but if the margin of design extends past the grille leave inside gray.

4. To make the output, you have to...shade the interior red but if the periphery of figure crosses beyond the mesh leave inside white.

5. To make the output, you have to...make the center green but if the extremity of pattern drifts away the lattice leave inside yellow.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...red vertical and horizontal lines. You can see the areas completely enclosed by lines, and you can also see a single red pixel.
