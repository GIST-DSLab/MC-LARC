- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...mirror the input grid, then change the color of every fifth pixel starting from the bottom-left pixel of each diagonal line to blue.

2. To make the output, you have to...invert the color of the input grid, then change the color of every odd-numbered pixel starting from the bottom-right pixel of each vertical line to green.

3. To make the output, you have to...replicate the input grid, then change the color of every even-numbered pixel starting from the top-left pixel of each diagonal line to yellow.

4. To make the output, you have to...duplicate the input grid, then change the color of every third pixel starting from the top-right pixel of each horizontal line to red.

5. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid, then change the color of the last pixel of each vertical line to purple.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...diagonal lines of colored pixels.
