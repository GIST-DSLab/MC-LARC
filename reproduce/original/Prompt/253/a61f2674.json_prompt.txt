- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...keep the shortest group of blocks gray, change the tallest group of blocks from blue to gray. Leave the remaining gray blocks as they are.

2. To make the output, you have to...change the shortest group of blocks from gray to red, change the tallest group of blocks from gray to blue. Change the remaining gray blocks to black.

3. To make the output, you have to...change all the blocks from gray to blue, change the shortest group of blocks from blue to red. Ignore the remaining gray blocks.

4. To make the output, you have to...change all the blocks from gray to red, leaving the tallest group of blocks blue. Ignore the remaining gray blocks.

5. To make the output, you have to...change the shortest group of blocks from red to gray, keep the tallest group of blocks gray. Change the remaining red blocks to black.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...several gray vertical lines of varying lengths. They are attached to the floor.
