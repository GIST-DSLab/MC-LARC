- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...ignore the top right 4x4 on output. add bottom left 4x4 pattern. color over the first color. disregard the other sections.

2. To make the output, you have to...take the top left 4x4 on output. add top right 4x4 pattern. do not cover the first color. do the same for each section.

3. To make the output, you have to...fuse the bottom right 4x4 on output. include the top left 4x4 pattern. avoid coloring the last color. don't repeat for each section.

4. To make the output, you have to...repeat the bottom left 4x4 on output. subtract the top left 4x4 pattern. cover every color except the first. repeat in only one section.

5. To make the output, you have to...discard the top left 4x4 on output. incorporate bottom right 4x4 pattern. skip coloring the first frame. apply this to all the sections.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...four sections composed with 4x4 grids placed on with a blue line dividing them. Each 4x4 grid section is their own colors and pattern.
