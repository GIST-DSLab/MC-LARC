- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...fill up the empty spaces with black color, ignoring the pattern of the blue section.

2. To make the output, you have to...replace all the blue sections with the color green, not caring about the red parts.

3. To make the output, you have to...modify the pattern using the color yellow without considering the form of the blue section. 

4. To make the output, you have to...paint the entire figure with purple while completely disregarding the blue portion's pattern.

5. To make the output, you have to...draw with red color to follow the pattern of the blue section and make one figure with 4 sections that look the same.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...one object with the same blue pattern repeated in three directions; above, to the right, and below.
