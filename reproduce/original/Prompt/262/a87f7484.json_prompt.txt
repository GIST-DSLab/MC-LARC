- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...find unique 3x3 pattern and replicate this 3x3 grid pattern to the output grid.

2. To make the output, you have to...discard 3x3 pattern and generate a new 5x5 grid pattern.

3. To make the output, you have to...randomize the 3x3 pattern and stretch it to fit a 4x4 grid.

4. To make the output, you have to...replace each cell in the 3x3 grid pattern with a random color.

5. To make the output, you have to...rotate the unique 3x3 pattern and scale it down to a 2x2 grid pattern.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a rectangle by concatenating some 3x3 one colored patterns. One of them is unique.
