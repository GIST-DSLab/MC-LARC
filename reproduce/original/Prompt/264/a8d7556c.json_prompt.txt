- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...paint all squares larger than 2 by 2 in blue.

2. To make the output, you have to...find where squares bigger than 1 by 1 can be form. Fill those with red.

3. To make the output, you have to...locate squares less than 1 by 1 and color them green.

4. To make the output, you have to...determine rectangles smaller than 2 by 2 and shade them in yellow.

5. To make the output, you have to...identify circles that are in the range of 1 by 1 and paint them with red.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
