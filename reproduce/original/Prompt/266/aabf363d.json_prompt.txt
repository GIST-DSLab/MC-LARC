- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...make the box at the top right corner black and the object at the center the color of the box at the bottom right corner

2. To make the output, you have to...make the box at the bottom left corner black and the colored object at the center the color of the box at the bottom left corner

3. To make the output, you have to...color both the box at the bottom left corner and center object as white.

4. To make the output, you have to...change the color of the object at the center to match the color of the box at the upper left corner

5. To make the output, you have to...keep the box at the bottom left corner white and make the object at the center the color of the box at the top right corner

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a colored object at the middle and a single box bottom left corner of a different color.
