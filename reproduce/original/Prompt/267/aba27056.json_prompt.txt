- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...erase all the black squares, color a curved line through the middle of the pattern red, and create one blue horizontal line across the top.

2. To make the output, you have to...fill in the pattern with yellow, color the black squares that make a straight line to the edge of the grid yellow, and create one yellow diagonal line from the line to the edge.

3. To make the output, you have to...outline all shapes with a thin red line, fill the border with black, and create a silver star in the center.

4. To make the output, you have to...draw a brown circle around the entire pattern, turn all corners of the grid pink, and form a blue zigzag across the grid.

5. To make the output, you have to...highlight the green sections, make sure all circles are purple, and form an orange square in the center of the grid.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a rectangle border with one side's center open and the inside empty.
