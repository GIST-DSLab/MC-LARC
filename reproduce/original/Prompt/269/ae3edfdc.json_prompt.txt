- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...remove all the blue and red boxes from the input grid and use the remaining colors to form a pyramid shape.

2. To make the output, you have to...start with a blue box in the center of the grid and arrange the orange and red boxes in a spiral design surrounding it.

3. To make the output, you have to...create 2 designs using all of the colored boxes in the input grid. One design is focused on the red box and the other one is focused on the blue box. Both the red box and the blue box will be in their exact same positions in the new grid. First put the red box in the same place as it is in the input grid. Now, look at the green boxes in the input grid and imagine that the green boxes are being pulled toward the red box until they are touching it. So, if there is a green box in the input grid above the red box, place it directly above the red box in the new grid. If there is a green box to the right of the red box in the input side, move it until it is directly to the right of the red box. Do the same for any other green boxes. After you are done, all of the green boxes should be touching the red box which is still in its original location. That design is done. Now use the same exact method for the blue box and surround it with the orange boxes. Think of the blue and red boxes as the centers of flowers and the green and orange boxes as the petals.

4. To make the output, you have to...arrange the boxes in a way that creates a striped pattern across the grid, alternating between orange and green colored boxes.

5. To make the output, you have to...utilize all the yellow boxes in the input grid to create a pattern with a green box at its center. Also, place all the red boxes around a solitary orange box. 

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a single red box and a single blue box. You can see green pixels on the same line as the red pixel, and orange pixels on the same line as the blue pixel.
