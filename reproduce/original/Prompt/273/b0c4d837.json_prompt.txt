- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...fill the entire grid with light green color except for the end rows with count of 14 or 9. If there are 10 light green blocks, output only one light green. If all 10 blocks are yellow then only put 3 light green. If five light green colors are sandwiched between two brown blocks, then just put 3 light green color in the last block.

2. To make the output, you have to...only use dark blue color on first 2 rows when middle of dark blue block count 3 or 16. If 14 dark blue color out put 3 dark blue. If 10 blocks are red then put 5 dark blue. If only five dark blue color in the middle of black block then just put 2 dark blue color in second block.

3. To make the output, you have to...just put light blue color on first 3 row when middle of light blue block count 2 or 15. if 12 light blue color out put 2 light blue. if 9 blocks are blue then put 4 light blue. if only four light blue color in the middle of grey block then just put 1 light blue color in first block.

4. To make the output, you have to...randomly add pink color in the leftmost 2 columns when count in the middle of pink block is 5 or 11. If you've placed 16 pink, then output 5 pink. If 10 blocks are gray, then put 4 pink. If five pink colors intermingled within a gray block, then simply put 4 pink color in the fourth block.

5. To make the output, you have to...apply dark red color unevenly across the grid, specifically on the last 2 rows when the count in the middle of dark red block is 1 or 12. If there are 13 dark red colors, output 4 dark reds. If all blocks are green, then put 3 dark red. If five dark red colors are centrally placed in the middle of a cyan block, then put 2 of the dark red color in the final block.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see... a U shape of grey block and light blue pixels are filling the inside of this 'U' shape from the bottom up to a certain level.
