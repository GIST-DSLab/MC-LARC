- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...color the two similar shapes the same blue color and then change the third shape to the red color.

2. To make the output, you have to...dye the two alike forms the same brown color and then alter the third form to the black color.

3. To make the output, you have to...paint the two identical shapes with the same red color and then modify the third shape with the blue color.

4. To make the output, you have to...tint the two similar structures the same purple color and then adjust the third structure to the orange color.

5. To make the output, you have to...shade the two related figures the same green color and then transform the third figure into the yellow color.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...three light blue objects. Out of the three, two of them have exactly the same shape.
