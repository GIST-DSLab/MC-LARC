- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... remove all the yellow triangles from the screen by dragging them off to one side.

2. To make the output, you have to... arrange the orange hexagons in a perfect circle in the middle of the screen.

3. To make the output, you have to... connect each pair of purple squares with a straight black line.

4. To make the output, you have to... stack blue circles on top of each other until they reach the top of the screen.

5. To make the output, you have to... place green boxes all the way around all of the paired red boxes.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see... single and paired red pixels on a black background.
