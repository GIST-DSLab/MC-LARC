- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...rotate the blocks in such a way that the grey blocks align along the corners and blue blocks at the center. The grey blocks are now converted to red.

2. To make the output, you have to...place the grey block in such a manner that it lays flat in between the east and west position. The north and south position holds the blue blocks while the grey block retains its color.

3. To make the output, you have to...use the grey block as the center of a square that is surrounded by alternating grey and blue blocks. Blue is at the north, east, south and west position. Change the grey center to black.

4. To make the output, you have to...set the grey block not as the center, but to the side of a square that is surrounded by blue and green blocks only. The center position is blank.

5. To make the output, you have to...organize the blocks in a circular fashion with the blue blocks enclosing the grey block. Change the blue blocks surrounding the grey center to green.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...gray pixels in different locations of the grid.
