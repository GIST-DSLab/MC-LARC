- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...resize the squares and adjust their hues. The corners transform into red. The middle morphs into green. The rim between the corners change to blue.

2. To make the output, you have to...stay the squares in the same place but change color. The corner become dark blue. The middle become red. The edge between the corner become yellow.

3. To make the output, you have to...rotate the squares by 90 degrees and change their color. The corner becomes purple. The middle becomes blue. The edge between the corners turns green.

4. To make the output, you have to...shift the squares diagonally and modify their shades. The angles turn into yellow. The nucleus alters to blue. The brink connecting the corners changes to green.

5. To make the output, you have to...invert the squares and alter their color. The corners transition to green. The center switches to yellow. The boundary between the corners switches to red.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...two gray rectangles.
