- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you need to...reduce the usually light-sensitive shapes into a pattern that imitates and shuffles the basic cluster of cubes making the "half-finished" pattern. The outcome will look like a comet or a fifth of this "comet".

2. To make the output, you should...zoom into the visibly faded elements into an artwork that buries and simulates the root series of elements that derive the "semi-structured" sequence. The effect will have a diamond-like image or two-third of this "diamond". 

3. To make the output, you must...replicate the right angular forms into a design that mocks and mirrors the base batch of modules that shapes the "incomplete" pattern. This will result in an output looking like a star or half of this "star".

4. To make the output, you have to...shrink the typically hueless objects into a sequence which copies and distorts the primary group of figures creating a "partially formed" module. The outcome will have a floral resemblance or a quarter of this "flower".

5. To make the output, you have to...expand the oddly colored cells into a pattern that mimics and mirrors the original set of cells that form the "fully formed" pattern. The output will have a snowflake appearance or a half or three-quarters of this "snowflake". In other words, 4 different colors bunched together will form a fully symmetrical "snowflake", while 3 will produce a "three-quarters" one. If that makes any sense.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...colored squares positioned into patterns. One "fully formed" pattern will have a uniform color. Differently colored blocks will butt against this first pattern
