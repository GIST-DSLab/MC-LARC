- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...remove the black squares and replace them with the colored boxes, taking the process from bottom to top of the shape.

2. To make the output, you have to...fill in the black squares by alternating the colors of the few colored boxes in other shape starting near the shape and only fill the boundaries of the shape and not all the black boxes

3. To make the output, you have to...place the colored boxes in the black squares, beginning at the top of the shape and filling in the entire shape.

4. To make the output, you have to...arrange the colored boxes in the other shape and transform them into black squares.

5. To make the output, you have to...paint all the black squares in the shape of the same color as the few colored boxes starting at the center of the shape.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a black paths constructed by light blue lines. It looks like a maze. And there is a object composed with two colors in the middle of the path.
