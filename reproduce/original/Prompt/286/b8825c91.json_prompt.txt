- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...change the yellow rectangles to red triangles

2. To make the output, you have to...add a few more yellow shapes to complete the arrangement 

3. To make the output, you have to...maintain the yellow rectangles and adjust their size 

4. To make the output, you have to...remove the yellow rectangles and replace the color to match the existing pattern

5. To make the output, you have to...eliminate all the shapes and start from scratch

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a radial symmetric pattern, but some parts are obscured by a yellow rectangles.
