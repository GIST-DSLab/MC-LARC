- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...paint the entire canvas with the most dominant color.

2. To make the output, you have to...create a diagonal line from the top to the sides with the less majority color.

3. To make the output, you have to...draw a circle in the center with the prevalent color.

4. To make the output, you have to...fill the entire sides with the more dominant color.

5. To make the output, you have to...leave the canvas completely blank.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a pattern that is symmetrical, attached to the bottom, with a different colored pixels in the center of the bottom. Additionally, there is a single pixel or a layer of original colored pixels stacked on top of it.
