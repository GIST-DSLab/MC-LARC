- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...switch the positions of the red and yellow shapes, but leave the blue shape in its original place.

2. To make the output, you have to...keep the blue shape where it is, and move the red and yellow shapes up or down so that they are at the same level as the blue-colored shape.

3. To make the output, you have to...remove the blue shape entirely and adjust the red and yellow shapes so they occupy its former position.

4. To make the output, you have to...push all three shapes together so they form one solid shape.

5. To make the output, you have to...tilt the blue shape at a 45 degree angle, and shift the red and yellow shapes to the right.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see... 3 objects with the same shapes of blue, red, and yellow colors.
