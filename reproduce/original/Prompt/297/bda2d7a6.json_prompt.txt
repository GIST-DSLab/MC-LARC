- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...invert the colors of all grids instead of swapping them.

2. To make the output, you have to...replace the color of the outer 6x6 grid with the color of the center 2x2 grid.

3. To make the output, you have to...keep all colors the same and swap the placement of 2x2 grid and 4x4 grid.

4. To make the output, you have to...resize all grids to 4x4 and paint them with the original 2x2 grid color.

5. To make the output, you have to...change the color of center black 2x2 grid to that of 4X4 grid color, 4X4 change to 6X6 color, and 6X6 change to old 2X2 color

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...squares of different sizes and colors. They overlap in order from the largest square to the smallest sqaure.
