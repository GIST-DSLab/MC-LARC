- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... put a red square at the point where a horizontal blue square and a vertical red square meet, leaving the surrounding four squares white.

2. To make the output, you have to... locate the horizontal red line and the vertical blue line from the middle, paint the cross section purple.

3. To make the output, you have to... draw a line from the centre to the right edge for the red squares and from the top to the bottom for the blue squares, keeping the overlapping section black.

4. To make the output, you have to... count the blue squares diagonally and the red squares vertically, leaving the square where they intersect as white.

5. To make the output, you have to... continue the pattern of red squares horizontal and continue the blue squares vertical to reach the edge of the grid. On the square that blue and red squares crosses, color that one yellow.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a 2-pixel light blue vertical line attached above and a 2-pixel red horizontal line attached the right or left.
