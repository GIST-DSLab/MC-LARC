The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:

2. To make the output, you have to...fully zoom in pattern of a highest color count among the gird.

3. To make the output, you have to...reduce the color count on the grid.

4. To make the output, you have to...erase the pattern from the gird.

5. To make the output, you have to...partially zoom out pattern of a lowest color count among the grid.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
