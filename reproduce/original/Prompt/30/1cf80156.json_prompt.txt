- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...change the color of the image to match the color of the new rectangular grid.

2. To make the output, you have to...rotate the colored image 90 degrees before placing it on the new rectangular grid.

3. To make the output, you have to...make sure the colored image is exactly fit (top, bottom, left, right) in the new rectangular grid. No color change.

4. To make the output, you have to...align the rectangular grid based on the mid-point of the colored image.

5. To make the output, you have to...ensure the size of the colored image is twice that of the new rectangular grid.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
