- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... keep all lines on the top of the grid and align them at the center.

2. To make the output, you have to... place the lines randomly in the grid without any specific order, with lines floating anywhere.

3. To make the output, you have to... rearrange the lines from largest at the bottom of the grid to smallest at the top. The final row need not be at the top of the grid. The lines should be aligned to the right side.

4. To make the output, you have to... arrange the lines from smallest at the bottom to largest at the top. Lines must align to the left side.

5. To make the output, you have to... arrange the lines from smallest to largest without caring about their position in the grid.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see... several different colored horizontal line segments of different lengths.
