- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...remove green circles having varying designs on the vertical lines.

2. To make the output, you have to...cover blue octagons with identical shapes in the circular path.

3. To make the output, you have to...fill in black tiles with the same tile pattern in the diagonal lines.

4. To make the output, you have to...empty red squares with different symbols in the horizontal lines.

5. To make the output, you have to...replace yellow rectangles with distinct patterns across the zigzag traces.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a pattern of diagonal lines. But some part covered by black grid.
