- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...divide each block into a 2x2 square in the same color as the original block. So, each block from the original input grid will become a 2x2 block of 4 squares of the same color as the original block.

2. To make the output, you have to...merge every 2x2 square into a single large block, maintaining the original color of each square.

3. To make the output, you have to...replace each block with a 2x2 square of contrasting color.

4. To make the output, you have to...rotate each original block 90 degrees clockwise according to its color.

5. To make the output, you have to...invert the colors of each original block in the grid to obtain a 2x2 square.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a random pattern made up of pixels in various colors.
