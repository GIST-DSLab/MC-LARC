- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... count the number of squares in the colored border and resize the output to that number. Then you color all the blocks to match the input.

2. To make the output, you have to... count the total number of pixels, regardless of color, and resize the output based on that. Then you color all the blocks the same shade of gray.

3. To make the output, you have to... ignore the colored borders and randomly assign colors from the 9 color palette.

4. To make the output, you have to... remove all colors from the input and use only black and white pixels in the output. The resizing is based on the smallest square within the colored borders.

5. To make the output, you have to... resize the output based on the largest square found within the borders. Then you fill all the blocks with different colors in a checkerboard pattern.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see....various colored vertical and horizontal lines that are haphazardly overlapped. And among them, you can see square borders made of a different color from the vertical and horizontal lines.
