- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... view the grid as a silent ocean and the colored squares as drifting boats. When a wave hits, these boats move randomly, leading to the output grid.

2. To make the output, you have to... think of the grid as a black field and as the colored squares as being objects floating in space. Gravity is suddenly turned on and all of the block fall vertically to the bottom. That produces the correct output grid.

3. To make the output, you have to... consider the grid as a blank map and the colored squares as continents. When a gust of wind blows, these continents will scatter around, creating an output grid.

4. To make the output, you have to... conceive the grid as an empty canvas and the colored squares as blotches of color. When you shake the painting, the colors will redistribute randomly across the canvas, thus forming the output grid.

5. To make the output, you have to... imagine the grid as a clear sky and the colored squares as balloons. When the wind blows, the balloons will float in different directions, generating the output grid.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see... several various color of pixels that are aligned vertically for the same color.
