- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...resize the pattern's width and keep the same row.

2. To make the output, you have to...replicate the pattern diagonally without changing the row.

3. To make the output, you have to...make the pattern mirror as left-right with the same height and twice the row.

4. To make the output, you have to...split the pattern into equal halves and maintain the row.

5. To make the output, you have to...reduce the pattern's height by half and triple the row.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...the orange pixels only.
