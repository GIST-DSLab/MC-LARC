- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...mirror the horizontal blocks and match them with the vertical colors.

2. To make the output, you have to...paint the horizontal blocks in contrast with the vertical colors.

3. To make the output, you have to...invert the colors of the horizontal blocks to match the vertical ones.

4. To make the output, you have to...color the horizontal blocks the same pattern as the vertical colors.

5. To make the output, you have to...strip the horizontal blocks to resemble the vertical colors.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see... a line of variously colored pixels on the left side. At the right side of the line, there are gray rectangles.
