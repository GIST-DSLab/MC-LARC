- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...delete the entire grid, then sketch a freehand drawing. Final image should be abstract art.

2. To make the output, you have to...invert the colors of the grid and leave it empty. Concluding task involves the grid remaining untouched.

3. To make the output, you have to...crop the grid into small pieces and randomly rearrange. The outcome must result in a mosaic.

4. To make the output, you have to...duplicate the entire grid, then fill in the solid color to exactly match the checker pattern. Finally result should be entirely checker patterned.

5. To make the output, you have to...paint patches of different colors on the grid. By the end, the product should represent a field of flowers.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a checker pattern with two colors. And right and below part has a solid single color grid.
