- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... disregard the red squares in your input as irrelevant. Then, arrange the 3x3 pattern randomly in the 9x9 grid.

2. To make the output, you have to...visualize the output grid as nine 3x3 blocks. The red squares on your input indicate which 'blocks' in your 9x9 grid you should work in. Copy the 3x3 input pattern to the 'blocks' indicated by the location of the red squares.

3. To make the output, you have to... consider each 3x3 input pattern as a separate 9x9 grid. Only focus on the red squares and ignore the arrangement pattern.

4. To make the output, you have to... iterate each 3x3 block with blue squares instead. Ignore the location indicated by the red squares.

5. To make the output, you have to... enlarge the input pattern to fill the entire 9x9 grid, treating each individual cell as a new 3x3 block.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a 3x3 grid of colored pixels with red and blue colors.
