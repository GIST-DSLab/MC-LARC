- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...view the elongated input as three segments of 2x2 grids, maintain the black spaces as they are and fill the colored blocks with blue.

2. To make the output, you have to...split the input into three sections as 5x5 grids, keep the black spaces black and paint the colored blocks in yellow.

3. To make the output, you have to...consider the long input as two sections as 4x4 grids, consider that the two sections as one.. then the leave that black spaces as black then point the colored blocks as green.

4. To make the output, you have to...take the input as four 3x3 grids, change the black spaces to brown and mark the colored blocks as red.

5. To make the output, you have to...segment the long input into two parts of 4x4 grids, convert the black spaces into green and represent the colored blocks as gray.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...two sections divided by horizontal yellow bar. In the upper section, there is a blue pixel pattern, while in the lower section, there is a red pixel pattern.
