- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...create a new layer and apply a black border.

2. To make the output, you have to...paint all the squares the same black color.

3. To make the output, you have to...wherever you see a color other than black make squares below that color the same color down to the border.

4. To make the output, you have to...find all the black squares and change them to a different color.

5. To make the output, you have to...emphasize every color except black by making their edges brighter.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.
