- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... begin from left rectangle towards the right. For new lines, try to adjust the color matching the foreground.

2. To make the output, you have to... sketch from the center circle to boundary. For the new lines, change the color to the one contrasting the background.

3. To make the output, you have to...draw from single square to diagonal out. For the new lines, make sure to keep the same color on background that is there before.

4. To make the output, you have to... start from the top triangle and radiate inward. Helps if you retain the initial color on foreground.

5. To make the output, you have to... trace from the outer circle to the inner. Ensure to apply a different color for the new lines contrasting the previous color.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...two color pattern with single pixels. The pixels in the same color region has same color.
