- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...shift the pattern from the starting point to the end row of the same sized canvas.

2. To make the output, you have to...truncate the pattern from the center to the edges of the new smaller grid.

3. To make the output, you have to...rotate the pattern from one side to another within the existing grid.

4. To make the output, you have to...repeat the pattern from the original corner to the other corner of the new bigger grid.

5. To make the output, you have to...flip the pattern from the top to the bottom of the old smaller grid.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...three pixels of different colors at random positions.
