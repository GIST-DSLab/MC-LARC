- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...draw alternating squares from the corner without crossing the middle horizontal or vertical to another color.

2. To make the output, you have to...color each square entirely in one color without blending.

3. To make the output, you have to...circle the perimeter without shading the inside.

4. To make the output, you have to...use only yellow to paint the edges without using orange on the same segment.

5. To make the output, you have to...diagonally cut across the square from the top right corner.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...at least two corner pixels with different color.
