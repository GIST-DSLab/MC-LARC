- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... reverse colors and keep the middle horizontal line of colored squares.

2. To make the output, you have to... fill the entire frame with color, leaving no black space.

3. To make the output, you have to... turn everything black, but keep the middle vertical line of colored squares.

4. To make the output, you have to... erase the center line and then fill everything black.

5. To make the output, you have to... change all colors to white but maintain the colored squares on the bottom line.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see... a random collection of colored pixels.
