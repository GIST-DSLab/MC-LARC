- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...place an apple next to any banana, a cherry on top of any banana, a plum next to the banana and a peach under any banana.

2. To make the output, you have to...insert a yellow hexagon to the left of any blue triangle, a red circle above any blue triangle, a purple diamond to the right of any blue triangle and a light blue pentagon below any blue triangle.

3. To make the output, you have to...place a orange square to the space left of any blue square, a red square in the space above any blue square, a purple square to the space on the right of any blue square and a light blue square to the space below any blue square.

4. To make the output, you have to...distribute green squares on any empty spots, place pink squares randomly on the canvas, scatter black squares randomly and align yellow squares using a grid pattern.

5. To make the output, you have to... place a light blue square to the right of any purple square, a red square below any orange square, a purple square above any red square and an orange square to the left of any light blue square.

- Things you have to do:
