- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... Starting with second horizontal, change gray to green every other vertical.

2. To make the output, you have to... Starting with second vertical, change gray to blue every other vertical.

3. To make the output, you have to... Starting with second vertical, change gray to green every other vertical.

4. To make the output, you have to... Starting with first vertical, change gray to green every other vertical.

5. To make the output, you have to... Starting with second vertical, change green to gray every other vertical.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a three-line pattern of gray pixels, with one gray pixels in each column, and there are no directly connected pixels.
