- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...paint the perimeter of the square green.

2. To make the output, you have to...change the color of the green square to the color of its adjacent squares.

3. To make the output, you have to...fill the same color of any square that is vertical or horizontal to the corner of the green square.

4. To make the output, you have to...fill the square directly to the right of the green square with the same color.

5. To make the output, you have to...circle the squares that are diagonal to the green square.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a green 2x2 square. Surrounding them are a few single pixels of different colors.
