- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...connect the dots on the orange grid using a purple line and extend it towards the border of the orange grid.

2. To make the output, you have to...draw an upward line with green where the blue grid's column intersect. then continue the green grid above the blue grid.

3. To make the output, you have to...delete the intersections on the silver grid, then trace the remaining lines of the silver grid using the brown marker.

4. To make the output, you have to...draw a down line with yellow to which the red grid's row meet. and continue the yellow grid to the side of the red grid.

5. To make the output, you have to...use a pink marker to circle all points on the black grid where it intersects with the white grid.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...one light blue pixel and one red pixel.
