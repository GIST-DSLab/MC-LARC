- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...color the white area with dark green and then draw a circle in the center of the grid.

2. To make the output, you have to...paint the grid in rainbow colors and mark the middle square as the starting point.

3. To make the output, you have to...cover the grid with black color and then draw a diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right.

4. To make the output, you have to...fill the gray with light blue then extend a line out the empty spot to the the end of the grid.

5. To make the output, you have to...use red to highlight the corners and connect them with a curvy line.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a gray rectangle border with one pixel missing. The missing pixel connects the inside and outside of the rectangle.
