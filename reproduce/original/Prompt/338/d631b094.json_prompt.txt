- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...color the whole output grid the color of the colored input grid blocks so there is a horizontal line of colored blocks.

2. To make the output, you have to...replace all colored blocks on the input grid with blank spaces.

3. To make the output, you have to...flip the colored input grid blocks vertically.

4. To make the output, you have to...remove all the colored blocks from the input grid.

5. To make the output, you have to...rotate the colored blocks from the input grid in a clockwise direction.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...one color of pixels on a black background at the random positions.
