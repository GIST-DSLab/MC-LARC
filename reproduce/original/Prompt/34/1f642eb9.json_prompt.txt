- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... make one similiarly colored squar inside the light blue figure for each colored square around the exterior. Place the colored squares along the most outer edge of the blue figure, closest to their corresponding block.

2. To make the output, you have to... form one differently colored circle inside the green figure for each colored triangle on the interior. Arrange the colored circles along the middle layer of the green figure, furthest from their corresponding block.

3. To make the output, you have to... assemble a single same-colored diamond within the red figure for each color-coordinated ball within the interior. Set the colored diamonds along the inner edge of the red figure, furthest from their matching block.

4. To make the output, you have to... generate one correspondingly colored line within the purple figure for every colored symbol outside the frame. Situate the colored lines along the central area of the purple figure, nearest to their associated block.

5. To make the output, you have to... construct one similiarly shaded hexagon inside the yellow figure for every colored rectangle along the exterior. Position the shaded hexagons at the innermost section of the yellow figure, closest to their relevant block.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see... a light blue rectangle, with colored single pixels scattered around the outside of the figure.
