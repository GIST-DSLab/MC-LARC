- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...rotate the input grid by 90 degrees and maintain the shapes as they are. The size isn't important.

2. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid and connect the two shapes with the blue grid.it must be smaller than the size of the small input shape.

3. To make the output, you have to...overlay the input grid with a green one, the size of the input shapes isn't relevant.

4. To make the output, you have to...split the input grid into two equal parts and color them with different colors. Ignore the size factor.

5. To make the output, you have to...remove the input grid and replace it with a red one. The size of the grid shouldn't be considered.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see... two different color rectangles with some blank space between them.
