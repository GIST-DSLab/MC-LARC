- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...maintain the same colors in the 2x2 grid as in the input grid.

2. To make the output, you have to...remove all the colors from the input grid and leave it blank.

3. To make the output, you have to...replace 2x2 same grid color with all other four different colors that in input grid. each 2x2 grid color are different in output grid 2x2.

4. To make the output, you have to...use only a single color to fill the complete grid.

5. To make the output, you have to...change only one color in each 2x2 grid.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...2x2 light blue square and four of different color pixels around the square.
