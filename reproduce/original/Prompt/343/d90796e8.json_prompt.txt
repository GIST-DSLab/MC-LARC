- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...find all instances of blue and red pixels, and swap their places.

2. To make the output, you have to...copy the exact entire image. Where ever a green and red pixel touch on their sides (not diagonal/corners), replace the green pixel with light blue, and replace the red pixel with black. (remove it)

3. To make the output, you have to...replace the entire image with a green filter overlay.

4. To make the output, you have to...rearrange the pixels in a random pattern, altering colours is not necessary.

5. To make the output, you have to...merge any adjacent green and red pixels into yellow ones, disregarding their position.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a grid with gray, green and red pixels with random positions.
