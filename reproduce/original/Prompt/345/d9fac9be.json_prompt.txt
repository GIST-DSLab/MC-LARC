- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...turn the center block of the input grid into the only gray block.

2. To make the output, you have to...zoom into the different colored center block from the input grid and make it the only colored block.

3. To make the output, you have to...extract the border blocks of the input grid and color them differently.

4. To make the output, you have to...keep the input grid unchanged.

5. To make the output, you have to...change all the colors of the blocks in the input grid.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a 3x3 square completely surrounded by pixels of different colors. Around it, pixels of the same color are scattered randomly.
