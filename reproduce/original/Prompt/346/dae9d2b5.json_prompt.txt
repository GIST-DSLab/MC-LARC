- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...take a screenshot of the left-side of the input and paste it onto the output. Then, fill the entire grid with green, followed by changing each green square to orange, hence creating an output of only orange and white.

2. To make the output, you have to...copy and paste the left-side of the input (the yellow side) onto the output grid. Then, draw the green pattern on the output grid on top of the yellow (do not copy and paste because the black will overwrite the yellow). Your output grid should now have green and yellow on a black background. Then, recolor each green and yellow square pink, so your output is only pink and black.

3. To make the output, you have to...simply mirror the right-side of the input on the output side, followed by erasing all the colors and replacing them with white and grey.

4. To make the output, you have to...delete everything from the input side and redraw the pattern on the output side using blue and red. Then, color the entire grid yellow.

5. To make the output, you have to...copy the right-side of the input grid onto the output grid. Then, draw the red pattern over the blue, and recolor each red and blue square purple, giving an output of only purple and white.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see... a 6x3 grid with a yellow pattern on the left 3x3 grid and a green pattern on the right 3x3 grid.
