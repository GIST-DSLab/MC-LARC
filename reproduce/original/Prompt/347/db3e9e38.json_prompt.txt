- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...copy-paste the input. starting on each side, alternate colors between orange and light blue, and decreasing the line by one block. So the colors should be orange in middle, then light blue, then orange, then light blue.

2. To make the output, you have to... start from one corner, alternate colors between black and white, and decrease the line by one block each time. The colors should be black in the middle, then white, then black, then white.

3. To make the output, you have to... start at the middle and alternate between pink and violet, each time reducing the line by one block. So the colors should be pink at the center, then violet, then pink, then violet.

4. To make the output, you have to... start from the middle and alternate between red and blue, without altering the line size. The colors should be red at the center, then blue, then red, then blue.

5. To make the output, you have to... begin at each edge, alternate colors between green and yellow, and collapse the line by two blocks every time. So the colors should be green in the center, then yellow, then green, then yellow.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a vertical line with orange color attached to the top side.
