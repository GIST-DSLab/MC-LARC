- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...inspect the pink cube located in different rows and lines. Sketch a separated green cube around the pink cube in different lines and rows.

2. To make the output, you have to...scrutinize the red hexagon residing in the same row but different line. Trace a detached gray hexagon next to the red hexagon at the same row and different line.

3. To make the output, you have to...check the dark blue grid which is at the same row and same line. draw a connected light blue grid between the dark blue grid at the same row and line.

4. To make the output, you have to...study the white circle that is found on the same column but different rows. Illustrate a disjointed purple circle beside the white circle at the same column and different rows.

5. To make the output, you have to...examine the yellow triangle positioned in varied lines and columns. Design an isolated orange triangle enclosing the yellow triangle at varied lines and columns.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...several single blue pixels scattered randomly.
