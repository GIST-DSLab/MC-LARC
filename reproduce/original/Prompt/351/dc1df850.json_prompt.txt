- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...surround only the red squares with a blue border that is one square wide.

2. To make the output, you have to...remove all the red squares and replace them with blue squares.

3. To make the output, you have to...fill in all the red squares with blue color completely.

4. To make the output, you have to...surround the green squares, not the red ones, with a blue border that is one square wide.

5. To make the output, you have to...draw a blue border that is two squares wide around the red squares.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a series of colored pixels on a black background.
