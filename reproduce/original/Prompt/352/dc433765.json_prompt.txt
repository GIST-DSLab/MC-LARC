- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...keep the yellow and green squares at a constant distance of three blocks.

2. To make the output, you have to...move the green square one block closer to the yellow square, no matter if it is horizontal, diagonal, or vertical.

3. To make the output, you have to...switch the positions of the yellow and green squares.

4. To make the output, you have to...move the yellow square one block away from the green square, regardless of the direction.

5. To make the output, you have to...place the green square exactly two blocks away from the yellow square under any circumstance.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...two pixels, one green and one yellow. And they are aligned either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. And each pixel is not connected.
