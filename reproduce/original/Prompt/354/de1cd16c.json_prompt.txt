- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...select the grid with the least number of colored squares and use that color.

2. To make the output, you have to...look for the colored grid with the largest number of colored squares and use that color.

3. To make the output, you have to...identify the smallest grid and color it completely.

4. To make the output, you have to...exclude all colored squares and focus on the uncolored ones.

5. To make the output, you have to...count the number of squares in each grid regardless of color.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...the grid divided into rectangles of various colors. And there are single pixels of one color scattered randomly.
