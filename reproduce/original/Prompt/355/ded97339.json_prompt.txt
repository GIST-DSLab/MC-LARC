- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...merge the red triangles that are directly opposite to each other.

2. To make the output, you have to...align the green circles that are indirectly diagonal to each other.

3. To make the output, you have to...reshape the yellow hexagons that are indirectly parallel to each other.

4. To make the output, you have to...connect the magenta boxes that are directly vertical and horizontal to each other.

5. To make the output, you have to...disconnect the blue squares that are not adjacent to each other.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...some pixels with same color on a black background.
