- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...shift all the random color squares outside of the bars.

2. To make the output, you have to...maintain all the random color squares and change the color of the bar they are in.

3. To make the output, you have to...generate additional colored squares that randomly mix into the bar. 

4. To make the output, you have to...remove all color bars and leave only random color squares. 

5. To make the output, you have to...eliminate all the random color squares and replace them with the color of the bar they are in.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...various colored single pixels scattered randomly, on a grid made up of large rectangels of various colors.
