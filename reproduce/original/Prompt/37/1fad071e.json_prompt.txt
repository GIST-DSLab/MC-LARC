- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...remove one blue grid from the center for each 2x2 blue grids available.

2. To make the output, you have to...fill single blue grid from the left for every 2x2 blue grids available.

3. To make the output, you have to...fill every single red grid for each 2x2 blue grids available.

4. To make the output, you have to...fill two blue grids from the right for every 2x2 blue grids available.

5. To make the output, you have to...leave all blue grids empty despite the 2x2 blue grids available.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.
