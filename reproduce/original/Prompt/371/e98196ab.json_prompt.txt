- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...mesh together both patterns from above and below the gray line.

2. To make the output, you have to...discard all patterns from above and below the gray line.

3. To make the output, you have to...only utilize the patterns from below the gray line.

4. To make the output, you have to...color the patterns above the gray line, then copy them below.

5. To make the output, you have to...draw new patterns instead of using the ones above and below the gray line.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...11x11 grid split into two 5x11 grids through a solid gray color horizontal line in the middle. The divided upper and lower grids each display patterns of different colors.
