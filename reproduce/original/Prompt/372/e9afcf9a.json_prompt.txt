- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...begin with a blank version of the pattern. Pick each color from top, and use that to shade every third square in a diagonal manner.

2. To make the output, you have to...start with the color that is on the top. Fill in that line with that color every other square, begin with first square. Fill in the rest in that line with the second color. For the next line, start with the color that is already there (the second color) and fill in in the same every other square pattern. It should look like a game board. The first color in every line is the color of the input grid

3. To make the output, you have to...start from the bottom-most line with the color that is there and color every other square. Follow the same for all lines until the top.

4. To make the output, you have to...begin with the last square of each line and fill every other square with that color. The rest of the squares should then be filled with a color of your choice.

5. To make the output, you have to...scramble the colors on the input grid randomly. This would then produce a multicolored and abstract output grid.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...2x6 grid and two horizontal lines with different colors.
