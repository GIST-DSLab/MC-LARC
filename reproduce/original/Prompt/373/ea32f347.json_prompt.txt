- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...connect the lines. The longest line needs to be linked with the middle length line. Then the shortest line needs to be merged with them.

2. To make the output, you have to...cross out the lines. The longest line needs to be erased first. The middle length line needs to be removed afterwards. The shortest line needs to be taken off last.

3. To make the output, you have to...change the color of the lines. The longest line needs to be colored blue. The middle length line needs to be colored yellow. The shortest line needs to be colored red.

4. To make the output, you have to...cut the lines. The shortest line needs to be halved first. The middle length line needs to be quartered. The longest line needs to be divided into multiple segments.

5. To make the output, you have to...lengthen the lines. The shortest line needs to be extended to the length of the middle one. The longest line needs to be lengthened even more.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...three gray lines of differing lengths on a black background.
