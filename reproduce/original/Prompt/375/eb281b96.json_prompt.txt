- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... create the grid. Then copy the original pattern onto the output grid. Next, create a mirror pattern from the original pattern underneath the original pattern. Then copy the whole original and mirror pattern to fill in the rest of the black grid.

2. To make the output, you have to... erase the entire grid. After that, reconstruct the original pattern in a random location on the new grid. Ignore the mirror pattern since it's not necessary. Finally, fill the rest of the grid with any random patterns.

3. To make the output, you have to... shatter the grid into pieces. Later, redefine the original pattern into something completely different. Work on a new design instead of mirroring the original. Complete the grid by scattering various patterns in a mosaic approach.

4. To make the output, you have to... sculpt the grid. Then redraw the original pattern on top of the already existing pattern. Next, create a polar opposite from the original pattern instead of a mirror. Fill the rest of the grid with the crafted inverse pattern.

5. To make the output, you have to... demolish the grid. Following destruction, discard the original pattern. Instead of mirroring the original pattern, create a brand new concept. Then fill the open spaces in the grid with the newly designed pattern, not using the original one at all.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...repeated diagonal line pattern with one color. It repeats in the left and right directions.
