- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... pick up random squares from the large pattern, regardless of the first square being black. 

2. To make the output, you have to... use only black squares in the large pattern and ignore all the others.

3. To make the output, you have to... use all the squares present in the large pattern, irrespective of the first square's color. 

4. To make the output, you have to...use the left most 9 squares of the large pattern, even if the first square in the large pattern is black.

5. To make the output, you have to... use the right most 9 squares in case the first square in the large pattern is black.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a large pattern on a black background.
