- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...insert blue triangles in the empty slots left by bright red hexagons diagonally.

2. To make the output, you have to...set light green diamonds in the voids left by dark orange squares vertically.

3. To make the output, you have to...position dark purple pentagons in the spacing offered by the light blue circles clockwise.

4. To make the output, you have to...put dark red squares in between the space that the light red squares across from each other only left to right squares.

5. To make the output, you have to...place bright yellow circles in between the gaps created by the dark green rectangles from top to bottom.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.
