- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...snatch the most vibrant checkered block, fling it within the star and extend the twisted line to verge. shade in star with color of star.

2. To make the output, you have to...grab the least visible striped block, thrust it to the core of the pentagon and unroll the double line to boundary. splash in pentagon with color of pentagon.

3. To make the output, you have to...carry the hardly seen square block, move it towards the heart's center and continue the wavy line to end. paint in heart with color of heart.

4. To make the output, you have to...pick up the smallest black block, set it inside the circle and pull the dotted line to corner. sketch in circle with color of circle.

5. To make the output, you have to...take the outstanding colored block, move it to outside the frame and continue the single line to edge. fill in frame with color of frame.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...squares with different colors inside and outside, and there are singular outstanding pixels around the inner squares.
