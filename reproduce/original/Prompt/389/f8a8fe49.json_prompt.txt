- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...rotate the grey pattern 90 degrees and ensure it rests on top of the red one. The resulting output will have the orange pattern inside the grey one.

2. To make the output, you have to...flip the red pattern over the orange one in a similar way to a mirror image. The resulting output should now have the orange pattern inside red one.

3. To make the output, you have to...invert the orange pattern and place it within the grey one. The resulting output should have the orange pattern surrounded by the grey one.

4. To make the output, you have to...flip the grey pattern over the red one like an mirror image. The resulting output should now have the grey pattern outside of the orange one.

5. To make the output, you have to...keep the grey pattern parallel to the red one. The resulting output should have the grey pattern next to the orange one.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...2 patterns in red that form a set of brackets you will see 2 other patterns in gray inside the brackets.
