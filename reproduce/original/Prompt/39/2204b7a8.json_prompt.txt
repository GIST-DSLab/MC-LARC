- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... invert the colors of the input grid.

2. To make the output, you have to... remove the border line from input grid.

3. To make the output, you have to... rotate the input grid 90 degrees.

4. To make the output, you have to... copy the input grid. change the color of each pixel in the black field to the color of the border line that each pixel is closest to. Done.

5. To make the output, you have to... enlarge the input grid.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see... a black field with two border lines of different colors. There are pixels of the same color scattered between the two borders.
