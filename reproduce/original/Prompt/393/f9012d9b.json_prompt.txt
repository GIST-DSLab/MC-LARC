- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...place the tiles on the board to form words vertically and horizontally.

2. To make the output, you have to...assemble all the pieces of the puzzle in a way that forms the intended image. 

3. To make the output, you have to...complete the flow chart to identify the steps in the process.

4. To make the output, you have to...fill in the grid so you that you finish the colored pattern that should go where the black squares are located.

5. To make the output, you have to...connect the dots in a way that each number is connected to the next in sequence.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a grid with a two color pattern and a black square in place of part of that pattern. You can see the repeating pattern.
