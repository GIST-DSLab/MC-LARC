- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...construct a mirror reflection of the shape from the input, with the color of the random pixels from input.

2. To make the output, you have to...pick the smallest shape from the input, replace its color with grayscale. Then.

3. To make the output, you have to...select several random shapes from the input, and rotate them according to the direction of the gradient pixels in the input.

4. To make the output, you have to...choose a medium size shape from the input and fill it with a neon color. Apply a gradient effect to the pixels of the shape.

5. To make the output, you have to...recreate the largest shape from the input, instead using the color of the random pixels from the input.Using that same color, fill in any random pixels that occured in the shape in the input, in the same position they are in in the input shape.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a black grid with colored rectangle borders and randomly placed pixels of a third color.
