- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...first, delete the input grid from the output grid. Then, replace each color contained within a 2x2 square with 1x2 green pixels.

2. To make the output, you have to...first, reposition the input grid on the output grid. Then, in each colored 2x2 square, insert 1x2 green pixels above the 2x2 grid.

3. To make the output, you have to...first, copy the input grid to the output grid. Then, for each color contained within a 2x2 square, add 1x2 green pixels below that 2x2 grid.

4. To make the output, you have to...first, invert the colors on the input grid to the output grid. Then, divide each 2x2 square to smaller 1x2 squares and fill them with green pixels.

5. To make the output, you have to...first, merge the input grid with the output grid. Then, for each color not present in a 2x2 square, add 1x2 green pixels next to that 2x2 grid.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...randomly colored 2x2 squares.
