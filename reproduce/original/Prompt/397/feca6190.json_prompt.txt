- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...begin at the top right corner of the output grid. Move down and to the left one block, paste the input there. Continue this until you reach the bottom left corner.

2. To make the output, you have to...ignore the input. Just fill the output grid randomly with blocks. There is no particular pattern.

3. To make the output, you have to...copy the input. Starting from the bottom left of the output grid, paste the input. Go back to the bottom left, move up one block and to the right one block, paste the input again. Go back to the bottom left, move up two blocks and right two blocks, paste the input again. Repeat this pattern until the leftmost square of the input grid is in the top right corner of the output grid. It will look like a diagonal pattern.

4. To make the output, you have to...start from the centre of the output grid. Paste the input outward in a circular pattern until all blocks are filled.

5. To make the output, you have to...start from the bottom left and paste the input across a straight horizontal line. Make sure all the blocks of the output grid are filled.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...1x5 grid with five multi-colored squares.
