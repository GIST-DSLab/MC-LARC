- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...leave the blue square empty.

2. To make the output, you have to...fill the blue square with the same pattern with the input grid. (that is.. the original pattern that need be there in the input)

3. To make the output, you have to...replace the pattern in the blue square with a different pattern from the input grid.

4. To make the output, you have to...colour the blue square according to your own preferences.

5. To make the output, you have to...erase all the patterns from the blue square.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a radial symmetric pattern with 5x5 blue squares. It covers some part of the pattern.
