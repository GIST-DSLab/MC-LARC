- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...sketch a line through the wide rectangular middle until you approach the boundaries of the monochrome zone.

2. To make the output, you have to...drain the expanse beneath the circular foundation until you reach the bottom of the transparent division.

3. To make the output, you have to...stretch the surface around the regular hexagonal sides till you touch the edge of the painted section.

4. To make the output, you have to...fill in the area above the four square base until you get to the top of the colored area

5. To make the output, you have to...shrink the space within the triangular peaks until you descend to the nadir of the blank segment.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...colored objects with a 2x2 square shape and lines drawn diagonally in both directions above it.
