- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...Leave the squares empty and arrange the colored shapes around them.

2. To make the output, you have to...Take a colored shape to fill in the hole for each square. It will only take one shape per square.

3. To make the output, you have to...Gather all the colored shapes and arrange them randomly in each square.

4. To make the output, you have to...Place multiple colored shapes in each square until it is completely filled.

5. To make the output, you have to...Only fill in the corners of each square using the colored shapes.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...grey rectangles with a black random shape in them. And outside of the grey ractangles, some colored blocks will fit in a black random shape in grey rectangles, and some will not.
