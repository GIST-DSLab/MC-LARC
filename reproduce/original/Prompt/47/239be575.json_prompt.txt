- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...make the color of the square the same color as the square that is five down and three across of the input.

2. To make the output, you have to...fill the square that is five down and three across of the input with a new pattern.

3. To make the output, you have to...flip the entire color scheme of the square.

4. To make the output, you have to...rotate the square 90 degrees clockwise.

5. To make the output, you have to...change the color of the square that is two down and two across of the input.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...several blue pixles and two 2x2 red squares on the black background.
