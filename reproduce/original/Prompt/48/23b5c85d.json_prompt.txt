- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...use the colors outside of the small inner grid pattern.

2. To make the output, you have to...copy the exact colors in the small inner grid pattern.

3. To make the output, you have to...design your own color scheme for the small inner grid pattern.

4. To make the output, you have to...invert the colors in the small inner grid pattern.

5. To make the output, you have to...discard the colors in the small inner grid pattern.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...several rectangles with different colors and sizes, and in some cases, they may be overlapping.
