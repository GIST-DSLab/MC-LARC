- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... scan the top and bottom parts of the input grid. Shade the areas of the output grid that are colored in the input grid with blue.

2. To make the output, you have to... check both the left and right parts of the input grid, but only color the output squares if a square is colored in the right part only.

3. To make the output, you have to... examine only the left part of the input grid. If there are any colored squares, replicate them onto the output grid.

4. To make the output, you have to... look at both the left and right parts of the input grid. You will notice that the left and right parts are 3x3. For each square that is colored on both the left and right parts, color the output grid with red on the new 3x3.

5. To make the output, you have to... consider the center square of the input grid. If it is colored, fill the entire output grid with green.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a 3x7 grid divided equally into a left blue pattern side and a right blue pattern side by a line of gray blocks.
