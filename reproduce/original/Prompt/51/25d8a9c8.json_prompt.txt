- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...stripe the row with pink if the colors are similar across the row. Blacken the row only if the colors are mismatched.

2. To make the output, you have to...fill the row with grey if the row has the same colors in the input. color the row with black if the row contain different colors.

3. To make the output, you have to...leave the row blank if the row has the same colors in the input. Use a blue marker to highlight the row if it has different colors.

4. To make the output, you have to...delete the row if the row comprises of same colors. Change the row color to white if the colors are divergent.

5. To make the output, you have to...paint the row with purple if the row displays identical colors. Change the row to yellow if the colors aren't matched.
