- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...rotate all the figures 90 degrees clockwise.

2. To make the output, you have to...shift all the shapes to the right by two grids.

3. To make the output, you have to...expand the size of the grid by adding two rows and two columns.

4. To make the output, you have to...move all the color move down by one grid.

5. To make the output, you have to...change the color gradient by increasing the saturation.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...3 by 3 grid blue color grid on black background
