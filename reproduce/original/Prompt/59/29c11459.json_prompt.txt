- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... slide green downwards to form 3 greens. pass the orange to the right to make 7 oranges. expose with the shape triangle.

2. To make the output, you have to... move blue to the right to make 5 blue. move red to left to make 5 red. present with color square.

3. To make the output, you have to... rotate yellow counter-clockwise to compose 6 yellows. push purple to right to form 4 purples. display in a circle button.  

4. To make the output, you have to... drag pink to up to make 8 pinks. pull black to the left to construct 2 blacks. symbolize with line drawing.

5. To make the output, you have to... shift white downwards to create 9 whites. move brown to the upper direction to form 8 browns. present with the image of a star.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...two pixels of different colors, horizontally aligned and positioned on the left and right sides.
