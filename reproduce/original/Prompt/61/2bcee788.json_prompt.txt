- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...merge the two shapes together, creating a new shape in the process. Then, reflect this new shape onto the grid with the same color. Fill the rest of the grid with light green.

2. To make the output, you have to...fill the entire grid with light green blocks, then add a smaller shape in any color of your choice.

3. To make the output, you have to...take the shape with more blocks and copy it exactly onto the output grid in the same color, then reflect it in the direction of the smaller shape. So you have an exact reflection of the larger shape. Color the rest of the background light green.

4. To make the output, you have to...draw lines that connect the corners of the shapes and fill in the resulting quadrilateral with the same color as the smaller shape.

5. To make the output, you have to...rotate the larger shape 90 degrees clockwise, then reflect it in the direction of the smaller shape. Fill the rest of the grid with light green.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...black grid with two colored shapes connecting to each other in middle.
