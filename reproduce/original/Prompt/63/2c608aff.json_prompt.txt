- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...create a curve between the dots and the central square instead of a straight line.

2. To make the output, you have to...connect it with a different color than the dot if the dots could connect to the central square with a straight line.

3. To make the output, you have to...ignore the color of the dot and prioritize the shape when connecting to the central square.

4. To make the output, you have to...disconnect the dots from the central square even if they can connect with a straight line.

5. To make the output, you have to...connect it with the same color as the dot if the dots could connect to the central square with a straight line.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a pattern with a central square and colored dots.
