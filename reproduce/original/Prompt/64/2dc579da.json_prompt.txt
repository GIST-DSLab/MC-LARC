- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...ignore the square color variations, just drag and drop the entire quadrant.

2. To make the output, you have to...select the quadrant with the same colored square, then rotate it as your output.

3. To make the output, you have to...use the erase tool on the different colored square, then save the quadrant. 

4. To make the output, you have to...select the quadrant with the different colored square, then copy and paste the quadrant as the output.

5. To make the output, you have to...draw a new square in the desired color, then delete the quadrant. 

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see... a grid broken up into 4 sections by a cross, where 1 section has an off-color single pixel in it.
