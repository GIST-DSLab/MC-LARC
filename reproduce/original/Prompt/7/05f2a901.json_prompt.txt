- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... insert the blue 2x2 square into the red shape without any movement.

2. To make the output, you have to... rotate the red shape to touch the blue 2x2 square without changing locations.

3. To make the output, you have to... bring the blue 2x2 square and the red shape together, without moving the blue square.

4. To make the output, you have to... keep the blue 2x2 square in the same spot. the red shape needs to move until it is touching the blue 2x2 square. You should move the red shape towards the blue 2x2 square either vertically or horizontally.

5. To make the output, you have to... move the blue 2x2 square to the spot where the red shape is currently located.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.
