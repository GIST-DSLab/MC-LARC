- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...recolor all elements on the grid without reference to the initial pattern.

2. To make the output, you have to...create and design your own pattern without minding the given one on the input grid.

3. To make the output, you have to...fill the blank spaces with any color you like. No need to replicate existing patterns.

4. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid to the output grid. You will see boxes where the pattern is missing. In these boxes, mirror the pattern from the opposite side of the grid, exactly. Use the same colors.

5. To make the output, you have to...ignore the input grid, just start drawing patterns as per your own preference.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a large grid with a multicolored pattern. Notice that the pattern is mirrored horizontally and vertically. But some parts are covered by brown rectangles.
