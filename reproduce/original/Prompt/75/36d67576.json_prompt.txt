- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...remove the red pattern from the yellow pattern.

2. To make the output, you have to...invert colors on the yellow pattern.

3. To make the output, you have to...merge the yellow pattern with the red one.

4. To make the output, you have to...repeat pattern shown on single yellow pattern onto others.

5. To make the output, you have to...copy the blue pattern onto the red pattern.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...yellow patterns with a single red square on each and one yellow shape with blue and green squares.
