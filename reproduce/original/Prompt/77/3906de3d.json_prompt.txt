- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...rotate the red 90 degrees clockwise around the blue.

2. To make the output, you have to...squeeze the red until it fits into the blue spaces.

3. To make the output, you have to...imagine the blue is a vacuum and sucks the red up into the open spaces. Move all red straight up.

4. To make the output, you have to...push all blue out of the way and fill the gaps with red.

5. To make the output, you have to...reverse the colors, making all red blue and blue red.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...black grid with blue color vertical lines at the top side and red color vertical lines at the bottom side
