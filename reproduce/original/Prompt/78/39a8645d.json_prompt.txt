- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... draw a new shape that matches the one with the most copies. Rotate the shape with the least copies. 

2. To make the output, you have to... delete all the shapes that have more than one copy. Calculate the size difference between the various shapes. 

3. To make the output, you have to... fill the shapes with different colors depending on their copies. Focus on the shape with the least copies. 

4. To make the output, you have to... replace all the shapes with their respective copies. Flip the shape with the most copies.

5. To make the output, you have to... count the number of copies of each shape. Zoom in on the shape with the most copies.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a few different kinds of 3x3 shape. Each kind should have a unique shape and color. There may be multiple copies of each kind.
