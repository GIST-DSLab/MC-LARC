- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...copy the input grid, replicate the main pixel placement within the grid and replicate half at the top right corner.

2. To make the output, you have to...scale the input grid, alter the main pixel placement within the grid and replicate the entire top right corner.

3. To make the output, you have to...invert the input grid, adjust the main pixel placement within the grid and ignore the top right corner.

4. To make the output, you have to...outline the input grid, change the main pixel placement within the grid and replicate only the center at the top right corner.

5. To make the output, you have to...rotate the input grid, maintain the main pixel placement within the grid and replicate a quarter at the top right corner.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...multiple sections divided by several vertical and horizontal lines. Some sections are filled with one color. Patterns consisting of a center and surrounding sections appear, and there are several more sections where only the central part repeats.
