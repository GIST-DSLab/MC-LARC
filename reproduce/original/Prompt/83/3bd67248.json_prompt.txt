- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... you need to make a yellow line perpendicular to the line located at the left half and then you draw a diagonal red line starting at the intersecting between both lines.

2. To make the output, you have to... create a green triangle at the upper right corner then connect it with a pink line across the lower left. 

3. To make the output, you have to... place a dot at the midpoint of the line segment on the left side before drawing a curve from one point to another. 

4. To make the output, you have to... start by rotating the given figure 90 degrees anticlockwise then sketching a blue circle around it.

5. To make the output, you have to... produce a square at the center and fill it with crosshatched lines using the right tool.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see... black background with a colored vertical line to the left side.
