- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...use triangles in between the rectangle shapes, not squares.

2. To make the output, you have to...alternate black and colored squares, but place them around the edges of the rectangle rather than in the middle.

3. To make the output, you have to...place colored squares randomly across the rectangle without any particular order.

4. To make the output, you have to...put black squares in the middle of the rectangle shapes so that the pattern is colored square, black square, colored square, black square and so on in the middle of each rectangle.

5. To make the output, you have to...fill the rectangle entirely with black squares, with no space for colored squares.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...two large rectangle shapes with different colors.
