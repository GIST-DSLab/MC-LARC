- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...rearrange the original input and embed it in the output. Next, change the saturation, then subtract the number of rectangles that filled the input rectangle from the center, preserve the color. Focus on the corners.

2. To make the output, you have to...rotate the original input and align it in the output. Then switch to grayscale, multiply the number of hexagons that filled the input hexagon by each side, flip the colors. Ignore the center.

3. To make the output, you have to...duplicate the original input and drop it in the output. Then adjust the contrast, add the amount of circles that filled the input circle to each corner, keep the color as it is. Be very careful about the corners.

4. To make the output, you have to...copy the original input and paste it in the output. Then inverse the colors, then add the amount of squares that filled the input square to each side, inverse the color. Do not worry about the corners.

5. To make the output, you have to...cut the original input and place it in the output. After that, just flip the output vertically, subtract the amount of triangles that filled the input triangle from each side, then rotate it 90 degrees.

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...a square with one color and filled with another color.
