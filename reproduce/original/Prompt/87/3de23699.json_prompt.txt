- Environment Explanation:
The given images consist of pairs of input and output images. The crucial aspect here is that these image pairs follow a common rule, and accurately inferring this common rule is the key.

Upon closely examining the given images, each image is structured as an NxM grid. (N and M are natural numbers.) There are a total of 10 pixel colors: black, blue, red, cyan, brown, pink, gray, yellow, and green.

I will provide you with several pairs of input-output images that adhere to a common rule.

Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...rotate the colored shape to align with the four corner squares.

2. To make the output, you have to...increase transparency of the colored shape based on the intensity of the four corner squares.

3. To make the output, you have to...delete the colored shape and replace it with the shapes in the four corners.

4. To make the output, you have to...change the color of the colored shape to the color of the four corner squares.

5. To make the output, you have to...reduce the size of the colored shape to match the size of the four corner squares. 

- Things you have to do:
Your task is to choose the option among the given choices that most accurately describes the relationship between the given images.
Please choose the most accurate option among the given choices numbered 1 through 5. Please respond with option [number]. Do not say anything else.

- Hint:
In the input, you should see...four colored pixels that look like the corners of a box. Within this box is a shape colored with a different color. The background is black.
