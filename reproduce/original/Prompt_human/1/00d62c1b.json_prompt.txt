Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...scrutinize the hue of the backdrop in the input. Locate any unoccupied parts of rectangles that are bound by the lines that inceive the additional design, dye them purple. You should wrap up with an amended blueprint of the original design from the input, with the unoccupied parts yed purple.

2. To make the output, you have to...observe the shape that forms the pattern in the input. Locate any filled regions of circles that are bordered by the curves that shape the secondary pattern, turn them green. You should finish with a completely different design from the input, where all filled areas are turned green.

3. To make the output, you have to...look at the color that form the design in the input. Find any empty areas of blocks that are enclosed by the lines that form the main design, fill them yellow.You should end with the same original design from the input, but with the empty areas filled yellow.

4. To make the output, you have to...study the pattern of the stripes in the input. Find any blank sections of spheres that are surrounded by the edges that construct the supplementary design, color them red. You should stop with an altered version of the original design from the input, with the blank sections painted red.

5. To make the output, you have to...examine the texture of the outline in the input. Identify any vacant spaces of squares that are confined by the contours that create the supportive design, stain them blue. You should conclude with a modified imprint of the original design from the input, having the vacant spaces stained blue.
