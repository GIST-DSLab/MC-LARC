Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...create a grid twice the size of the input. Divide the output grid into 4 quadrants. Replicate the input grid pixels in the upper right quad. In the upper left quad, place the input grid that's been rotated clockwise 90 degrees. In the lower right quad, place the input grid colored pixels that has been rotated 180 degrees. In the lower left quad place a copy of the input grid that's been rotated 90 degrees COUNTER-CLOCKWISE. Done.

2. To make the output, you have to...construct a grid just as big as the input. Partition the output grid into equal halves. Reproduce the input matrix pixels on the right side. On the left side, reverse the screen display of the input grid. Then do nothing with the remaining grid cells. Done.

3. To make the output, you have to...develop a matrix three times more extensive than the input. Cut up the output matrix into six portions. Copy the input network modules in the center portion. In the adjacent portions, place the input grid that's been turned around completely once. Done.

4. To make the output, you have to...build a checkerboard that is double the size of the input. The checkerboard should be split into 8 sections. Recurate the input grid cells in one section. In the remaining sections, alternate the input grid that's been flipped on its horizontal axis. Done.

5. To make the output, you have to...create a grid half the size of the input. Separate the output grid into 2 sections. Replicate the input grid snippets in the upper sector. In the lower sector, place the input grid that's twisted at a 45 degrees angle. Done.
