Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...invert the diagonal pattern in the spaces with the black spots, creating a contrast to the rest of the grid.

2. To make the output, you have to...remove the black spots entirely to ensure that they do not mar the uniform pattern of the grid.

3. To make the output, you have to...replace the black spots with random patterns that do not necessarily follow the diagonal pattern of the rest of the grid.

4. To make the output, you have to...expand the size of the black spots instead of filling them in, keeping the overall grid pattern uneven.

5. To make the output, you have to...fill in the black spots with the continued diagonal pattern that is in the rest of the input so it looks like there is a uniform pattern on the whole grid
