Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...start at the colored square and add a same colored square to make a x shape for the whole square

2. To make the output, you have to...create a spiral pattern originating from the colored square, ignoring the x shape suggestion.

3. To make the output, you have to...randomly fill the square grid with different colors regardless of the starting square.

4. To make the output, you have to...start at the corner of the grid and work inwards without concern for color.

5. To make the output, you have to...begin at the colored square and form a z shape instead of an x shape.
