Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...reverse the input grid in the top right 3x3. Then, copy the top right 3x3 and set it in the top left 3x3. Now, duplicate the top left and right 3x3 and locate in the lower left and right 3x3.

2. To make the output, you have to...turn the input grid around the middle 3x3. Then, duplicate the middle 3x3 and locate it in the bottom left 3x3. Now, imitate the bottom 3x3 and place in the upper and lower right 3x3.

3. To make the output, you have to...flip the input grid in the center 3x3. Then, rotate the center 3x3 and place it in the bottom right 3x3. Now, reflect the bottom right 3x3 and place in the top right and left 3x3.

4. To make the output, you have to...place the input grid in the top left 3x3. Then, reflect the top left 3x3 and place it in the top right 3x3. Now, reflect the top left and right 3x3 and place in the bottom left and right 3x3.

5. To make the output, you have to...move the input grid to the lower left 3x3. Then, spin the lower left 3x3 and position it in the top right 3x3. Now, replicate the top right 3x3 and place in the upper left and lower right 3x3.
