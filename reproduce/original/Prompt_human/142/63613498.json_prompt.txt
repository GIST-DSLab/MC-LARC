Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... remove the shapes outside of the grey border. Rotate the shapes inside the grey border to a different orientation. Maintain the same colour for all the shapes.

2. To make the output, you have to... enlarge all shapes outside of the grey border which do not have the same orientation and shape as the one inside the border. Do not alter the colour of the shapes.

3. To make the output, you have to... shrink any shapes that are inside the grey border and not of the same shape and orientation. Change the remaining shapes to blue.

4. To make the output, you have to... copy the input grid. Find any shapes outside of the border which are exactly the same shape and orientation as the shape inside of the grey border. Turn that shape grey. Do not change the colored shape inside the grey border or any shapes outside of the grey border which do not have the same orientation and shape as the one inside the border.
