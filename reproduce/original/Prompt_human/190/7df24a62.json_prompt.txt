Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...erase all instances of the yellow pattern from the grid. Draw additional blue boxes next to the existing ones.

2. To make the output, you have to...move the yellow/blue pattern to a different location on the grid. The pattern and colours stay the same, just change their position.

3. To make the output, you have to...change all the blue boxes in the grid to yellow. Leave the pattern as it is, just adjust the colours.

4. To make the output, you have to...reverse the pattern. Make the yellow boxes blue and the blue boxes yellow. 

5. To make the output, you have to....copy and paste the exact same grid. Find all instances of the pattern that is surrounded in blue. Everywhere on the grid where there is the exact yellow pattern, surround it with blue. So, on all sides of the yellow boxes (in the same pattern) will be blue boxes(exactly as shown in the yellow/blue pattern)
