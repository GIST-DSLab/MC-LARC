Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...switch the positions of the top 4x4 grid of green pixels and the bottom 4x4 grid of blue pixels. After switching the positions, change all the black pixels to green. All other pixels, whether blue or green, should be changed to black.

2. To make the output, you have to...overlay the top 4x4 grid of green pixels over the bottom 4x4 grid of blue pixels or vice versa.After you complete the overlay whichever pixels are still black will be changed to red in the output. All the other pixels which are green, blue, or both will be changed to black

3. To make the output, you have to...combine the 4x4 grid of green pixels with the 4x4 grid of yellow pixels. In this combined grid, change all the black pixels to red. All other pixels, whether green, yellow or both, should be changed to black.

4. To make the output, you have to...overlay the top 4x4 grid of red pixels over the bottom 4x4 grid of blue pixels. After completing the overlay, change all the yellow pixels to green in the output. All other pixels, which are red, blue, or a mixture of the two, should be changed to brown.

5. To make the output, you have to...move the top 4x4 grid of green pixels aside the bottom 4x4 grid of blue pixels. Then change all the black pixels to red in the finished product. All the other pixels which are green or blue will be left untouched.
