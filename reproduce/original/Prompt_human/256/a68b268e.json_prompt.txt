Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...ignore the top right 4x4 on output. add bottom left 4x4 pattern. color over the first color. disregard the other sections.

2. To make the output, you have to...discard the top left 4x4 on output. incorporate bottom right 4x4 pattern. skip coloring the first frame. apply this to all the sections.

3. To make the output, you have to...repeat the bottom left 4x4 on output. subtract the top left 4x4 pattern. cover every color except the first. repeat in only one section.

4. To make the output, you have to...take the top left 4x4 on output. add top right 4x4 pattern. do not cover the first color. do the same for each section.

5. To make the output, you have to...fuse the bottom right 4x4 on output. include the top left 4x4 pattern. avoid coloring the last color. don't repeat for each section.
