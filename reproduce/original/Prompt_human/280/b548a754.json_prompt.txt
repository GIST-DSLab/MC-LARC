Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...shrink it until it completely disappears inside the dot and then remove the color within the inscribed square or rectangle. This should contract the shape away from the dot.

2. To make the output, you have to...color the entire diagram using the inner color over the dot, and then replace the existing shape with a circle or oval. This should round out the shape and relocate the dot in the center.

3. To make the output, you have to...stretch it until the outer color covers the dot and then fill in the shape with the inner color from where the outer square or rectangle is.This should stretch the shape in general towards the dot itself.

4. To make the output, you have to...rotate the shape until it aligns with the dot and then fill it with an outer color from the location of the largest square. This should twist the form towards the indirect corner.

5. To make the output, you have to...invert the hue until it matches the dot's brightness and then fill the figure using the outer color from where the cylinder is. This should flip the shape's color spectrum towards the dot's shade.
