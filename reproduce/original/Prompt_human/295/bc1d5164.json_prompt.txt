Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to... rotate the original grid in a spiral motion. The colored dots stay stationary on the background.

2. To make the output, you have to... tilt the original grid at different angles. The colored dots roll off the background.

3. To make the output, you have to... pull the original grid outward on all sides. The colored dots disperse into the background. 

4. To make the output, you have to... shake the original grid back and forth. The colored dots scatter across the background.

5. To make the output, you have to... imagine you are squishing the original grid horizontally and vertically. The colored dots move and overlap on top of the background.
