Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...make each across and down row different, ignoring the middle block in each row.

2. To make the output, you have to...randomly distribute the blocks on each row without any pattern.

3. To make the output, you have to...connect the first and last blocks, leaving the middle blocks unattended.

4. To make the output, you have to...make each across and down row identical, matching the middle block in each row to the end blocks.

5. To make the output, you have to...only focus on the middle block and disregard the alignment of the end blocks.
