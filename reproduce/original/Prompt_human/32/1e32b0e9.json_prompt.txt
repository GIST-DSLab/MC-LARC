Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...copy what is inside of the bottom left 6x6 grid throughout the bottom of the 8 grid formation. The tint of these excessive blocks should oppose the tint of the block cut line.

2. To make the output, you have to...echo what is inside of the middle 4x4 grid over the rest of the 8 grid cluster. The shade of these surplus blocks should complement the shade of the block cut line.

3. To make the output, you have to...mirror what is inside of the top right 2x2 grid across rest of the 8 grid series. The hue of these added blocks should clash with the hue of the block cut line.

4. To make the output, you have to...replicate what is inside of the top left 5x5 grid throughout the rest of the 8 grid left. The color of these additional blocks should match the color of the block cut line.

5. To make the output, you have to...duplicate what is inside of the bottom right 3x3 grid throughout the right of the 8 grid set. The color of these extra blocks should contrast the color of the block cut line.
