Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...combine the orange and grey into one pattern that take up a 4x3 space. Fill each black space with green. Fill the old pattern with black. You should only have green spaces.

2. To make the output, you have to...overlap the blue and yellow in a 6x4 rectangle. Paint each pink square in red. Replace the previous pattern with a white one. You should only have red squares.

3. To make the output, you have to...keep the orange and grey separately and fill them in a 5x2 space. Fill each white octagon with purple. Remove the old pattern completely. You should only have purple spaces.

4. To make the output, you have to...merge the pink and violet to form a shape that occupies a 2x2 area. Fill the existing white circles with blue. Create a new pattern with orange. There should only be blue circles.

5. To make the output, you have to...mix the brown and white in a way that they form a 3x2 board. Fill up the remaining vacant patches with yellow. Replace the past design with a new brown one. You should only see yellow patches.
