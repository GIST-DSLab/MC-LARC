Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...first, reposition the input grid on the output grid. Then, in each colored 2x2 square, insert 1x2 green pixels above the 2x2 grid.

2. To make the output, you have to...first, delete the input grid from the output grid. Then, replace each color contained within a 2x2 square with 1x2 green pixels.

3. To make the output, you have to...first, merge the input grid with the output grid. Then, for each color not present in a 2x2 square, add 1x2 green pixels next to that 2x2 grid.

4. To make the output, you have to...first, copy the input grid to the output grid. Then, for each color contained within a 2x2 square, add 1x2 green pixels below that 2x2 grid.

5. To make the output, you have to...first, invert the colors on the input grid to the output grid. Then, divide each 2x2 square to smaller 1x2 squares and fill them with green pixels.
