Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...entirely change the shape you see outside of the boxes to a different one. Center the new shapes on the multicolored squares inside the boxes. Avoid extending any part of the shapes to the box edges. Keep the background untouched. Perform these steps on every box with a differently colored square inside.

2. To make the output, you have to...use the shape outside the boxes invertly. Avoid centering it above the single squares that are differently colored inside the boxes. Extend lines randomly from different parts of the shape until they touch the sides of the box. Work on every box regardless of the different colored square inside.

3. To make the output, you have to...copy the shape you see outside of the boxes. Take note of the center square of the shape outside the box. Position the shape in the box, centered over the the single squares in the boxes that are a different color. Next, take note of the squares that extend two spaces out from the center of the shape. Now, using the same color as these squares, continue their lines until they touch the sides of the colored box. Don't go into the background color. Repeat these steps for all boxes with a different colored square inside.

4. To make the output, you have to...concentrate on the edge squares of the shape outside the box rather than the center. Situate the shape in the box, shifting away from the differently colored square. Extend the lines from the squares three spaces away from the shape's center until they reach the box. Leave the background unchanged. Repeat these for all boxes regardless of the colored square inside.

5. To make the output, you have to...look at the overall design outside of the boxes and disregard the center square. Position the design randomly in the box, ignoring the single differently colored squares inside the boxes. Do not extend the lines from the squares in the design. Do this for all boxes.
