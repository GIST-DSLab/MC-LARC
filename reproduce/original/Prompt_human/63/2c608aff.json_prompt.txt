Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...ignore the color of the dot and prioritize the shape when connecting to the central square.

2. To make the output, you have to...create a curve between the dots and the central square instead of a straight line.

3. To make the output, you have to...connect it with a different color than the dot if the dots could connect to the central square with a straight line.

4. To make the output, you have to...connect it with the same color as the dot if the dots could connect to the central square with a straight line.

5. To make the output, you have to...disconnect the dots from the central square even if they can connect with a straight line.
