Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...copy the original input and paste it in the output. Then inverse the colors, then add the amount of squares that filled the input square to each side, inverse the color. Do not worry about the corners.

2. To make the output, you have to...cut the original input and place it in the output. After that, just flip the output vertically, subtract the amount of triangles that filled the input triangle from each side, then rotate it 90 degrees.

3. To make the output, you have to...rotate the original input and align it in the output. Then switch to grayscale, multiply the number of hexagons that filled the input hexagon by each side, flip the colors. Ignore the center.

4. To make the output, you have to...rearrange the original input and embed it in the output. Next, change the saturation, then subtract the number of rectangles that filled the input rectangle from the center, preserve the color. Focus on the corners.

5. To make the output, you have to...duplicate the original input and drop it in the output. Then adjust the contrast, add the amount of circles that filled the input circle to each corner, keep the color as it is. Be very careful about the corners.
