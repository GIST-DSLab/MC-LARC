Here are the options:
1. To make the output, you have to...turn the grid 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

2. To make the output, you have to...invert the grid vertically and then horizontally. 

3. To make the output, you have to...rotate the grid 180 degrees clockwise. That's it. Just fill in the grid with the original colors as if the grid rotated twice to the right (180 degrees).

4. To make the output, you have to...reorient the grid by swapping the top and bottom halves. 

5. To make the output, you have to...flip the grid diagonally.
