Next, re-position the boxes into new locations in the output grid without maintaining their previous neighbors. Boxes of the same color can be placed close together but not in a fixed pattern related to the original grid. Imagine the grid as a canvas and the colored boxes as blobs of paint being splattered randomly onto it. This will result in an output grid with scattered colored boxes in unexpected locations.","To make the output, you have to...arrange the colored boxes in the input grid by aligning them horizontally. One pattern starts with the green and orange boxes, while the red and blue boxes adjust accordingly afterward. Begin by aligning the green box horizontally to the leftmost side of the grid and continue placing adjacent green boxes to its right in a horizontal line. Follow the same method for the orange boxes, placing them horizontally in the middle row. Finally, position the red and blue boxes along the last horizontal row, alternating between them. This results in a horizontally aligned pattern with orderly rows of green, orange, red, and blue boxes in the output grid.","To make the output, you have to...rotate each cluster of colored boxes 90 degrees clockwise while keeping their relative positions intact. Start by isolating clusters of adjacent green and orange boxes in the input grid, along with individual red and blue boxes if they are adjacent to their clusters. Once identified, rotate each cluster 90 degrees clockwise, maintaining the distance and positions among the boxes within each cluster. Imagine turning a square with colored pegs 90 degrees without changing the pegs' distances from the center. This process will give a rotated arrangement in the output grid.","To make the output, you have to...invert the positions of the colored boxes from the input grid while maintaining the overall structure. This means flipping the colors vertically and horizontally relative to the grid's center. First, locate all the colored boxes in the input grid, including green, red, blue, and orange. Next, invert each box so that a box on the top left moves to the bottom right, and one on the top right moves to the bottom left. The pattern follows the same transformation of flipping a mirror image, ensuring that relative positions are mirrored. This method places all boxes in an inverted but organized manner into the output grid.",1
