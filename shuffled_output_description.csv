381,f15e1fac,"To map the output, you must... Begin by duplicating the source grid and keeping it unchanged. Use brown pentagons as a spot to construct arcs, so if the brown pentagons rest on the bottom, you draw arcs upwards horizontally and if the brown pentagons are on the left, you have to sketch the arc facing right vertically. Next, following the copied grid, create arcs from each brown pentagon and end right after crossing the grid with the initial pink hexagon. Then you continue to draw your second brown arcs from the grid containing the pink hexagon; nevertheless, the arc should be twisted by one grid according to the position of the pink hexagon, if it?ï¿½s on the top; the second arc will twist downwards, if it?ï¿½s on the left; the arc will twist to the right and if it?ï¿½s on the right, it will twist towards the left. These second brown lines stop right after passing the grid with the fourth pink hexagon. At the end, another set of brown arc should be drawn obeying the same rule as of the second arc straight to the terminal grid.","To produce the output, what you need to do... First, replicate the pattern on the initial grid without change. The purple rhombus manages as a reference for you to construct shapes, so if the purple rhombus is situated on the top, you need to sketch shapes horizontally downwards and if the purple rhombus is on the right, the shapes should be drawn vertically left. Then, following the pattern gained from the grid, construct shapes from each purple rhombus and halt exactly at the grid with the third orange circle. Now, to draw your second purple shapes starting from the grid with the orange circle, but, the shape will need to zigzag according to the location of the orange circle, if it's at the left, the second shape will zigzag to the right, if it's at the top, it will zigzag down and if the orange circle is on the right, the second shape will zigzag to the left. These second purple shapes stop exactly on the grid with the second orange circle. Then, the construction of another set of purple shapes is made following the identical rule as of the second shape till the final grid.","To create the output, you can... Begin by ignoring the initial grid and drawing a new one completely. Having green circles as your point of origin, if the green circles are positioned on the right, you must draw vertical lines to the left and if they sit at the bottom, horizontal lines upwards are to be drawn. Following this, after constructing the new grid, draw lines from each green circle and halt only after crossing the tile with the first yellow triangle. Then, you proceed to sketch your second green lines starting from the tile housing the yellow triangle, nonetheless, the line will need to shift two tiles in accordance with the location of your yellow triangle - if positioned at the top it will shift the second line down by two tiles, if at the left it moves the second line two tiles right, and if the yellow triangle is on the right, the second line will be moved to the left by two tiles. These second green lines stop only after passing the tile with the second yellow triangle. Lastly, you will sketch a final group of green lines following identical rules as of the second line, all the way to the edge of the grid.","To make the output, you have to... First, copy the input grid and leave it as it is. The blue squares act as a starting point for you to draw lines, so if the blue squares are on the left, you have to draw lines horizontally to the right and if the blue squares are at the top, you have to draw the line vertically down. Next, after copying the grid, draw lines from each blue squares and stop just before the grid with the first red square. Then you will start again to draw your second blue lines starting from the grid with the red square, however, you will have to move your line by one grid according to the position of your red square - if your red square is at the bottom, you will move the second line up by one grid, if your red square is at the right, you will have to move your second line left by one grid and if your red square is at the left, you will have to move your second line to the right by one grid. These second blue lines stop just before the grid with the second red square. You will then draw another set of blue lines with the same rule as the second line all the way to the end of the grid.","If you want to bring out the output, do this... First, repeat the original grid and keep it unchanged. Utilize cyan triangles as a series to depict curves, so if triangles are on the top, you should show curves downwards horizontally and if the triangles are on the left, you depict curves on the right vertically. The next step is to draw curves from each cyan triangle and stop right before getting to the grid with the second green diamond. This is followed by illustrating your second cyan curves from the grid with the green diamond. You should take note that the curve will have to swerve by one grid according to the green diamond's position, if the diamond is on the right, the second curve swerves left by one grid, if the diamond is at the bottom, it will swerve upwards by one grid and if green diamond is located on the left, the curve will swerve to the right. These second cyan lines stop just before getting to the grid with the third green diamond.

398,ff28f65a,"To create the output, you need to start with a 4x4 white output grid. Count the number of 3x3 green rectangles in the input. That's your count of squares that you'll fill with light green (never dark green) in your output. The positioning starts from the bottom right with squares filled after skipping one. (For example: If you've 4 3x3 green rectangles in the input, you'd fill the bottom left and bottom right squares of your 5x5 output with light green. For 3 green rectangles, you'd fill the bottom left, bottom right, and the central square with light green). Therefore, switch positions every time, also when moving upwards in your output grid- you never have consecutive greens or a green directly above the other. Squares not filled with green should be changed to red.","To produce the output, start with a 7x7 brown output grid. Take into account the amount of 4x4 orange circles in the input. This is equivalent to the amount of circles that will be colored in light orange (not dark orange). Begin filling in the squares from the bottom left, leaving one square in between. (For example: If the input has 3 4x4 orange circles, paint the bottom left and the square next to the right of your 5x5 output with light orange. If there are 4 circles, paint the bottom left, next right, and the middle square with light orange). Always switch places, even when going to a higher row in your output grid- there shouldn't be two oranges in a line, or an orange directly above another one. Any squares that aren't filled in with orange ought to remain brown.","To structure the output, initiate with a 8x8 purple output grid. Record the amount of 5x5 cyan hexagons on your input. This will be the quantity of hexagons you'll color with light cyan (avoid dark cyan). Starting at the middle, fill in the squares of your grid by alternating one (an instance: If the input brings about 2 5x5 cyan hexagons, fill in the middle and one square down of your 6x6 output grid with light cyan. In case of 3 hexagons, color the middle, one above, and one below squares of the output grid with light cyan. Thus, always switch, even going diagonally for your output grid - there mustn't be two cyan squares in line or a cyan directly next to another. All squares not filled with cyan should be painted purple.","For generating the output, begin with a 6x6 gray output grid. Count and note the number of 1x1 yellow triangles in the input. That equates to the number of triangles you'll color with pink (not dark pink) in the output. You should start filling the squares from the top right, skipping a square in between. (For instance: If the input has 5 1x1 yellow triangles, you'd have to fill the topmost right and the second square from the left of your 4x4 output grid with pink. If there are 6 triangles, fill the topmost right, second left, and the middle square with pink). So, always alternate the positions, even when moving sideways in the output grid??there should never be two pink adjacent squares, or a pink square directly beside the other one. All the squares that aren't filled in with pink should remain gray.","To make the output, you have to...make a 5x5 black output grid. Then count how many 2x2 red squares there are in the input. That is how many squares you will fill in the output with dark blue (not light blue). You will fill in the blue squares every other square, starting in the top left (example: If there are 2 2x2 red squares in the input, you would fill in the top left and top right of your 3x3 output with dark blue. If there are 3 2x2 red squares in your input, you would fill in the top left, top right, and middle middle squares with dark blue. So, always alternate, even when you move to a lower row of your output - there should never be two blues in a row or a blue directly underneath of another one.
